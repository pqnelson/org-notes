Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms for solving the
problems of continuous mathematics, by which we mean problems
involving real or complex variables. (This definition includes
problems like linear programming and the traveling salesman problem
posed over the real numbers, but not their discrete analogues.)

--- Lloyd N. Trefethen, "Numerical Analysis" in {{{book-title(Princeton Companion of Mathematics)}}} (2006)

The basic outline of the subject, as presented in most textbooks,
first presents floating-point arithmetic, then root finding
algorithms, polynomial interpolation, quadrature, numerical linear algebra,
then using the numerical linear algebra to solve differential
equations. Once all this has been established, various other ways
to solve differential equations are discussed in graduate courses
or their own texts.

 with, at least on computers
