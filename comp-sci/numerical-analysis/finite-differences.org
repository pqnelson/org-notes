For instabilities arising from finite differences, see Rouson and
friends "A grid-free abstraction of the Navier-Stokes equation" (2008)
wherein are "provided a more subtle example inwhich information that
appeared to have been lost during the discretization process was
actually missing from the original PDE."
After reading the paper carefully, it seems Rousson and friends do the
following:

1. Review a version of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
   equation. Specifically, one which reduces down to 2 equations in 2
   unknowns. 
2. Consider the Fourier spectral method for numerical analysis.
3. Show the equations from step 1 have problems at wavelength $\vec{k}=0$,
   which reflects a loss of information.
4. *Assert* this loss of information occurs in every consistent scheme.
