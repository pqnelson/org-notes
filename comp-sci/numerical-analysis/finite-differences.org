For instabilities arising from finite differences, see Rouson and
friends "A grid-free abstraction of the Navier-Stokes equation" (2008)
wherein are "provided amore subtle ex ample inwhich information that
appeared to have been lost during the discretization process was
actually missing from the original PDE."
