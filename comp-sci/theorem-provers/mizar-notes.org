- ~Element of X~ is defined in [[http://www.mizar.org/version/current/html/subset_1.html][~subset_1.miz~]] , lines 67 /et seq/.
- ~Subset of X~ is defined in [[http://www.mizar.org/version/current/html/subset_1.html][~subset_1.miz~]] (line 99), but it just means
  ~Element of bool X~; and ~bool X~ is defined in [[http://www.mizar.org/version/current/html/zfmisc_1.html][~zfmisc_1.miz~]]
  (line 71) as ~bool X -> set means Z in it iff Z c= X~ (and ~c=~ is the
  subset operator, defined in [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/tarski.html][~tarski.miz~]], as we would expect its
  meaning $X\subseteq Y\iff (\forall x, x\in X\implies x\in Y)$)

- Inverse operator is denoted by double quotes, so ~x"~ denotes $x^{-1}$
  as defined in [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_1.html][~group_1.miz~]] line 210 (~func h" -> Element of G means h * it = 1_G & it * h = 1_G;~)
  - This is also extended to, for a group $G$, subsets $A\subset G$
    we'd have ~A"~ be the collection of ~g"~ for ~g in A~, i.e.,
    $A^{-1}=\{g^{-1}|g\in A\}$; see line 57 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]]
    #+begin_example
let G be Group;
let A be Subset of G;
func A " -> Subset of G equals :: GROUP_2:def 1
{ (g ") where g is Element of G : g in A } ;
    #+end_example
- the mode definition ~Subgroup of G~, line 853 of  [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]]; for
  some reason, if $H\lt G$, then ~carr(H)~ is defined as the subset of the
  underlying set of $G$ equal to the set underlying $H$
- If $H_{1}\lt G$ and $H_{2}\lt G$, then $H_{1}\cap H_{2}$ is defined on line
  1563 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]]
- The trivial subgroup of $G$ is denoted ~(1).G~, defined on line 1258
  of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]] as
  #+begin_example
  func (1).G -> strict Subgroup of G means
  :Def7:
  the carrier of it = {1_G};
  #+end_example
  - "strict" is a weird meta-term (c.f., [[http://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/forum/archive/0701/msg00008.html][discussion]]),
    #+begin_quote
"strict" doesn't have its own definition as it is a special (in a way "meta" attribute) - it means that a term which has a structure type <Theta> has exactly the same selectors (fields) as introduced in the definition of the type <Theta>, so in your case only the selectors of a doubleLoopStr - any extension to that would break the "strictness". So you may think of a vector space as of a group, but it's not a "strict" group.
    #+end_quote
  - "strict" for subgroup is on line 1011 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]]; it's a
    registration of a cluster. I believe it refers to being a proper
    subgroup.

- ~(Omega).G~ (line of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]]) seems to be the other trivial subgroup of $G$, i.e., $G$ itself
  - This seems to be following notation introduced in  [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/rlsub_1.html][~rlsub_1.miz~]],
    line 764; a comment before it notes this notation is used for
    improper subspaces
- Left cosets are defined on line 2448 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]] (right cosets
  are defined on line 2468)
- The index of a subgroup $H\lt G$ is defined as the cardinality of left
  cosets of $H$  on line 2789 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_2.html][~group_2.miz~]]

- Conjugation of $a$ by $b$ (both elements of $G$) is denoted
  ~a |^ b~, defined on lines 299--300 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_3.html][~group_3.miz~]]
  - This is extended to subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$, ~A |^ B~ is the
    collection of conjugating elements of $A$ by elements of $B$
    ~func A |^ B -> Subset of G equals {g |^ h : g in A & h in B};~
  - We also have ~g |^ A~ and ~A |^ g~ for conjugating an element by
    members of a subset, and conjugating a subset by an element
- Conjugate subgroup to $H\lt G$ is defined lines 897 /et seq/ of
  [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_3.html][~group_3.miz~]] as ~H |^ a~ (conjugate subgroup of a finite group is
  itself finite, as registration on line 1068 notes)
- ~a,b are_conjugated~ defined on line 1270 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_3.html][~group_3.miz~]] if there is a $g\in G$ such
  that ~a = b |^ g~ (and two subsets are conjugated, defined on line
  1523; for two subgroups on line 1738)
- Conjugacy class of $a\in G$ is defined as the subset of $G$ given by
  ~a |^ carr (Omega).G~ around line 1367 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_3.html][~group_3.miz~]] (and the
  conjugacy class of a subset of $G$ is defined around line 1615; the
  conjugacy class for a subgroup defined on line 1810)
- A normal subgroup is defined on line 1956 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_3.html][~group_3.miz~]] as
  ~for a holds IT |^ a = the multMagma of IT~ and then it is registered
  as ~strict normal~
- The normalizer for a subset $A\subset G$ is defined on line 2419 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_3.html][~group_3.miz~]]
  as ~func Normalizer A -> strict Subgroup of G means :Def14: the carrier of it = {h : A |^ h = A};~
  (normalizer of a subgroup is defined on line 2638)
- If $A$ is a subset of a group $G$, the ~gr A~ seems to be the smallest
  subgroup containing $A$
- Frattini subgroup is tricky. Relevant code starts around 1371 of  [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_4.html][~group_4.miz~]]
  #+begin_example
::$N Frattini subgroup
  func Phi(G) -> strict Subgroup of G means
  :Def7:
  the carrier of it = meet{A
where A is Subset of G : ex H being strict Subgroup of G st A = the carrier of
H & H is maximal} if ex H being strict Subgroup of G st H is maximal otherwise
  it = the multMagma of G;
  #+end_example
- The notation $H_{1}\wedge H_{2}$ for the smallest group containing
  both $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ (defined line 1877 [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_4.html][~group_4.miz~]]) it is given
  the name ~SubJoin~ on line 2636; dually, the submeet is defined on
  line 2680

  and ~commutators G~ is defined as the commutator of the underlying set
  of $G$ with itself
- A triple $[a,b,c]=[[a,b],c]$ line 662 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_5.html][~group_5.miz~]]

  on line 1262; and similarly for subgroups ~[.H1,H2.]~ defined on line 1297

- a group $G$ is "simple" if ~IT is not trivial~ and there is no
  nontrivial normal subgroup $H\triangleleft G$ (i.e., $H\neq 1$ and
  $H\neq G$) line 998 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_9.html][~group_9.miz~]]
- The quotient group $G/N$ is denoted as ~G./.N~ in Mizar, and it is
  defined on line 1469 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_9.html][~group_9.miz~]]; the canonical mapping of $N\to G/N$
  is defined on line 1759 as the ~nat_hom~
- Two groups $G$ and $H$ ~are_isomorphic~ if there exists a bijective
  group morphism between them (line 1693 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_9.html][~group_9.miz~]])
- The kernel of a morphism of groups-with-operators is defined on line
  2137 of [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_9.html][~group_9.miz~]]
