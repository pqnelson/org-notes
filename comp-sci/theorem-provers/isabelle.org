* Introduction

Isabelle is a +metalogical+ [[file:logical-framework.org][logical framework]] (but Isabelle/HOL /is/ a
metalogical framework, which is a logical framework that allows us to prove results
about deductive systems; this is because HOL is a metalogical framework).
Recall, logical frameworks reason within deductive systems. Isabelle is
a bit like a tool to create proof assistants, which is why we often see
things like ~Isabelle/X~ for various choices of ~X~.

* Earley Parsing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-5fd08e66-0648-4579-bdcd-5331dfabc3a8
:END:

The "object logic" is parsed using an Earley parser, as noted in the
section "Parsing and unparsing" of [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/Doc/Implementation/Syntax.html][Documentation about Syntax]]
(Chapter 3 of the [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/Doc/Implementation/implementation.pdf][PDF]] version of the documentation):

#+begin_quote
Actual parsing is based on traditional lexical analysis and Earley parsing
for arbitrary context-free grammars.
#+end_quote

I always wondered if the rumours were true about Isabelle using an
Earley parser, now we know.

* Symbols and Strings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-e4bc5319-45ec-473b-aa2c-c06ca79dcc7d
:END:

The basic unit of text is a "symbol" (roughly analogous to a "character"
in most other languages). A symbol is one of the following:

1. An ASCII character
2. A codepoint according to UTF-8
3. A regular symbol ~\<ident>~ for things like Greek letters in a
   TeX-like format
4. A control symbol ~\<^ident>~ for things like bold, emphasis, etc.

This was introduced in Isabelle98 according to Wenzel's "Isabelle as
Document-oriented Proof Assistant" (2011).

The 1998 version can still be accessed on the
[[https://isabelle.in.tum.de/download_past.html][Older Isabelle Releases]] page.
