Kaliszyk and Pak have implemented [[file:../mizar.org][Mizar]] as an "object logic" in
Isabelle, which is intriguing. They have published several iterations of
this, and their latest one (in 2019) is the most
sophisticated. Particularly intriguing is how they present their
encoding to work "atop" some foundations (again, encoded in Isabelle; so
we could have I/Mizar work atop of I/HOL or I/FOL [or I/*]).
