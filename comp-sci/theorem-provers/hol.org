Broadly, HOL refers to a /family/ of theorem provers which emerged out
of LCF, using similar techniques applied to higher-order logic as Church
presented it in his article on simple-type theory.

It turns out HOL is a metalogical framework. One way to encode inductive
datatypes, for example, may be found in John Harrison's [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/tutorial.pdf][tutorial]] on HOL
Light in section 15.
