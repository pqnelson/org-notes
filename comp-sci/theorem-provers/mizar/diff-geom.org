* Mapping out what has been formalized

There seems to be some work done on topological manifolds, but not much
on differential manifolds. So far, there does not appear to be a notion
of atlases or charts (so far as I can tell, at least).

- [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/mfold_0.html][~mfold_0~]] on [[http://mizar.org/fm/2014-22/pdf22-2/mfold_0.pdf][topological manifolds]] is a retcon, retroactively
  introducing a notion of a locally Euclidean space which covers
  manifolds with and without boundary.
  - [[https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/version/current/html/mfold_0.html#V1][~locally_euclidean~]] means for every point $p\in M$ there exists a
    neighborhood $p\in U\subset M$ such that there exists an
    $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $M|_{U}$ is homeomorphic to the
    n-dimensional disk.
  - [[https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/version/current/html/mfold_0.html#NM1][~topological_manifold~]] is a non-empty Hausdorff second-countable
    locally-Euclidean topological space
- [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/mfold_1.html][~mfold_1~]] formalizes
  [[http://mizar.org/fm/2011-19/pdf19-1/mfold_1.pdf][the definition of topological manifolds]] following Jack Lee.
  - [[https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/version/current/html/mfold_1.html#T8][~MFOLD_1:8~]] proves the unit ball and $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are homeomorphic
  - [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/connsp_2.html][~connsp_2~]] formalizes notions related to being a neighborhood to a
    point in a topological space, which is used when defining the
    attribute ~locally_euclidean~ (~MFOLD_0:def2~).
  - [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/mfold_1.html#V2][~n-manifold~]] is defined as a Hausdorff, second-countable, $n$
    locally Euclidean space.
- [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/mfold_2.html][~mfold_2~]] formalizes examples of manifolds, namely
  [[http://mizar.org/fm/2012-20/pdf20-1/mfold_2.pdf][planes, spheres, and stereographic projection]].
- [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/connsp_1.html][~connsp_1~]] formalizes notions of [[http://mizar.org/fm/1990-1/pdf1-1/connsp_1.pdf][connected spaces]]
  - [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/borsuk_2.html#V1][~pathwise_connected~]] is an attribute defined in
    [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/borsuk_2.html#V1][~BORSKU_2:Def3~]]
- [[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/connsp_3.html][~connsp_3~]] formalizes notions of [[http://mizar.org/fm/1996-5/pdf5-4/connsp_3.pdf][components]]

However, what is lacking is...well, a bit. For example:

- Charts and Atlases
  - This is tricky, because there are two conventions for defining a
    chart, and they are completely opposite of each other.
    - *Convention 1:* Given a
      manifold $M$ we could define a chart as $\varphi\colon U\subset M\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$
      being a homeomorphism with its image. The mapping in this direction (from patch of
      manifold to Euclidean space) is called the local coordinate for the patch.
      - Bourbaki follows this convention, at least I infer as much from
        /Lie Groups/, III \sect1.1 Lemma 1
        (page 210 of my paperback copy);
      - Warner's /Foundations of Differential Geometry and Lie Groups/ 
        (Def.1.3) follows this convention;
      - Isham's /Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists/ follows this
        convention (Def.2.1 in \sect2.2).
      - Spivak's /Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry/,
        vol. I, appears to follow this convention (for every $x\in M$
        there is a neighborhood $U\subset M$ of $x\in U$ which is
        homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ --- pg 1; but
        also see chapter 2, where smooth structures are defined using
        charts following this convention)
      - If I recall correctly, both Tu and Lee follow this convention.
    - *Convention 2:* Given a manifold, a chart is a mapping
      $\varphi\colon V\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\to M$ which is a homeomorphism
      with its image. The mapping in this direction (from a patch of
      Euclidean space to the manifold) is called a local parametrization
      for the manifold.
      - Milnor follows this convention,
      - do Carmo's /Riemannian Geometry/ uses this convention.
      - Besse's /Einstein Manifolds/ (\sect1.41)
        appears to have a chart be from a patch of Euclidean space to the
        manifold.
      - When I took Dr Fuchs's
        course on differential topology, the convention used followed Milnor
        (I suspect to avoid people copying proofs from Tu, Lee, and friends).
  - Compatible charts
  - Atlas = family of pairwise compatible charts which cover the manifold
  - Equivalent atlases = the union of the atlases is another atlas
  - Two atlases are equivalent if and only if every chart from one atlas
    is compatible with every chart from the other atlas.
  - The relation (equivalent atlases) is transitive
  - A subset of the manifold is open (with respect to an atlas) if blah
    blah blah. Atlases induce a topology.
- Mappings between manifolds
  - Embedding, Immersion, Submersion, Diffeomorphism, Local Diffeomorphism
  - Partitions of Unity
- Products of Manifolds
  - There are other related constructions (the disjoint union of
    manifolds of the same dimension, and the connected sum), but I'm not
    sure how necessary they are to begin with...
- Submanifolds
- Tangent Vectors and Vector Fields
  - Tangent bundle, double tangent bundle
- Differentials of Smooth Maps
- Morse Theory
- Differential Forms
