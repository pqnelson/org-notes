* Overview

In programming, there's this idea of DRY code ("don't repeat yourself"),
where we carve out helper functions if the exact sequence of code is
repeated twice or more. In mathematics, we have this idea too, where we
abstract away a predicate or functor. We call them "schemes".

For example, if we have a family of subgroups satisfying "some property"
$\{H\leq G : P[H]\}$, then the intersection of all these subgroups forms
another subgroup. This is a scheme (namely, ~MeetSbgEx~ found in
[[http://mizar.org/version/current/html/group_4.html][~GROUP_4~]]).
