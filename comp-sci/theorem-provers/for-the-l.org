Back in the '60s by V. Glushkov, Soviet mathematicians began working on
formalizing mathematics with computers. Their work continued with
V. Bodnarchuk and K. Vershinin, introducing rudiments of the "Formal
Theory Language" (ForTheL) as the input language for "Systems for
Automatic Deduction" (SAD).
