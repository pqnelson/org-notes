* Introduction

There are 211 instructions in 14 categories:

- 10 list-function
- 24 predicate
- 29 numeric
- 10 data-movement
- 8 field-extraction
- 10 array-operation
- 19 branch-and-loop
- 20 block
- 12 function-calling
- 4 binding
- 2 catch
- 24 lexical-variable-accessing
- 11 instance-variable-accessing
- 28 subprimitive.

Also note there are about 2 or 3 dozen different types of an argument.
(See, e.g., the [[https://tumbleweed.nu/r/lm-3/uv/chinual.html#Data-Types-1][manual]] of a lisp machine emulator).

* List-Function Operations

1. ~car~,
2. ~cdr~,
3. ~doc:set-to-car~,
4. ~doc:set-to-cdr~,
5. ~doc:set-to-cdr-push-car~,
6. ~rplaca~,
7. ~rplacd~,
8. ~doc:rgetf~,
9. ~zl:member~,
10. ~zl:assoc~

** car

Argument(s): 1,
- ~(car <dtp-list>)~ pushes the car onto the stack (a cons cell)
- ~(car <dtp-locative>)~ (a locative pointer)
- ~(car <dtp-list-instance>)~ (an object reference to a list instance)
  pushes the car of the list instance onto the stack,
- ~(car <dtp-nil>)~ (primitive data type, nil) pushes nil onto the top
  of the stack

If the argument is a dtp-list, then this will push the car of ~arg~ onto
the stack.

If the type is dtp-locative, this pushes the contents of the location
~arg~ references onto the stack.

If the type of arg is dtp-nil, this pushes ~nil~ onto the stack.

** cdr

- ~(cdr <dtp-list>)~ pushes the cdr of the arg onto the stack
- ~(cdr <dtp-locative>)~ pushes the contents of the location arg
  references onto the stack
- ~(cdr nil)~ pushes nil onto the stack

Post trap: Type of arg is ~dt-list-instance~

Memory reference: cdr-read, then data-read

TOS Register effects: valid afer

** set-to-car

Basically ~(set-to-car arg)~ is the same as ~(set! arg (car arg))~.

- ~(set-to-car <dtp-list>)~ replaces the argument with the car of the
  argument
- ~(set-to-car <dtp-locative>)~ replaces the contents of the memory
  cells at location with its car
