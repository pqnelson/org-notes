There are 5 equality predicates in Common Lisp:

1. [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_eq.htm][~eq~]] tests if its arguments point to the same ["identical"] object;
   - there is no guarantee this works on numbers, e.g., ~(eq 3 3)~ may or
     may not be true (it's implementation dependent)
2. [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_eql.htm][~eql~]] is like ~eq~ but handles numbers (of the same type) being
   equal, and characters being equal
   - ~(eql x y)~ is true when ~(eq x y)~ is true
   - ~(eql 3 3)~ is true
   - ~(eql 3 3.0)~ is false because ~3~ and ~3.0~ belong to different types
   - ~(eql #\A #\A)~ is true
   - ~(eql #\a #\A)~ is false (because ~eql~ is case-sensitive)
   - ~(eql "foo" "foo")~ may or may not be true, it depends on the implementation
3. [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_equal.htm][~equal~]] tests if two objects represent "the same" value
   - For numbers, ~equal~ defers to ~eql~; so ~(equal 3 3.0)~ is false
     because it evaluates to ~(eql 3 3.0)~
   - For lists, it checks if the ~car~ are ~equal~, then checks if the
     ~cdr~ are ~equal~
   - For arrays, it checks equality using ~eq~ (i.e., they are pointers
     to the same object)
   - For objects, it checks equality using ~eq~
4. [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_equalp.htm][~equalp~]] an even more lenient version of ~equal~
   - Two instances of the same class are tested by recursively checking
     if each slot are ~equalp~ to each other; *Warning:* this may fail
     to terminate!
   - Arrays should be tested using ~equalp~
5. [[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_eq_sle.htm#EQ][~=~]] tests if numbers are equal, regardless of type
