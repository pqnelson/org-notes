When writing code, it's natural to organize them by modules or
packages. Common Lisp has packages. Packages are namespaces for symbols.

* Conventions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-80a2a256-dc93-4a29-8ec7-b361f6443607
:END:

** Use Uninterned Symbols
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-e5e5b16c-8daa-4b51-a15d-19a2abb15ccb
:END:

*Convention:* Use uninterned symbols for package names and exports.

*Rationale:* We do this because, otherwise, we would have the following:

#+begin_example
[1]> *package*
#<PACKAGE COMMON-LISP-USER>
[2]> (defpackage bar)
#<PACKAGE BAR>
[3]> (find-symbol "BAR")
BAR ;
:INTERNAL
#+end_example

But using uninterned symbols:

#+begin_example
;; Uninterned symbols don't cause symbol pollution:
[4]> (defpackage #:foo)
#<PACKAGE FOO>
[5]> (find-symbol "FOO")
NIL ;
NIL
#+end_example

We could use strings, too, but in that case we would have to use
SCREAMING CASE.

** One Package May Have Many Files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-56dccc70-81c9-4b7b-a46d-3ad9acc3c420
:END:

*Convention:* One package may have many files.

*Rationale:* Java required 1 class per file, and organized classes into
packages and subpackages. Many languages copied this convention, and it
seems to have become a ubiquitous convention.

Common Lisp doesn't quite follow this pattern. But it may be useful to
have 1 file per class (so as to quickly find relevant code). In that
case, we would have a package generically look like:

- ~class_1.lisp~
- ...
- ~class_N.lisp~
- ~package.lisp~ lists the ~defpackage~ declarations

Examples of this:

- [[https://github.com/cffi/cffi/blob/master/src/package.lisp][CFFI]]
- [[https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-client/blob/master/quicklisp/package.lisp][Quicklisp]] for multiple ~defpackage~ declarations
