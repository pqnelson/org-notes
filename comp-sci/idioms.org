* DAMP and DRY code

** DRY = "Don't Repeat Yourself"

- Refactor production code to avoid duplicated code

** DAMP = "Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases"

- For DSL, DRY may produce unsatisfactory code (less readable, harder to
  maintain business logic, etc)
- Hence we would prefer /descriptive and meaningful phrases/ in our DSL
- For unit tests, we also prefer DAMP code
- The acronym "DAMP" seems to have been coined with DSLs in mind by
