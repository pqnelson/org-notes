As a profession, this is the most insane (in a negative way) profession
with unrealistic demands on people's time.

As a hobby, Roguelike development explores the "space" of interesting
issues you'd probably want to think deeply about.

I'm curious about what Common Lisp can bring to the table, because it
could ostensibly simplify development (or streamline it using a suitable DSL).
