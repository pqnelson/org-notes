* Overview

Computer science has emerged into a sprawling field. Although I am
trying to focus on numerical analysis (to think further about
solving math and physics problems), the entire domain of
programming and computer science are rather fascinating.

Right now, I am working my way through the =scmutils= library used
in {{{book-title(The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics)}}}.
As I read through it, I'm thinking about how to implement the
algorithms in Common Lisp.

- [[file:apology.org][Apologia]] on various random conventional choices I've been forced
  to make
- [[file:numerical-analysis.org][Numerical Analysis]] for all my computational needs
- [[file:literate-programming.org][Literate Programming]] is one method to programming, as espoused by
  Donald Knuth
- [[file:theorem-provers.org][On Theorem Provers]]
- [[file:abstract-machines.org][Abstract Machines]] as virtual machines for functional programming
  languages, began originally as pen-and-paper models of computer hardware
  + [[file:abstract-machines/secd.org][SECD Machine]] the primordial abstract machine which started it all
- [[file:lisp.org][Lisp]], the second-oldest language around, is my preferred language
  for programming most things
  + [[file:lisp/machine.org][Lisp Machine]] lore, partial history, sketchy and incomplete specifications
  + [[file:lisp/multiple-dispatch.org][Multiple Dispatch]] for multimethods, which can be implemented in
    various different ways
  + [[file:lisp/generic-arithmetic.org][Generic Arithmetic]] using multimethods for overloading operators
  + [[file:lisp/mal.org][Make a Lisp]] a literate program experiment, using a generic blub (C)
    to implement a Lisp interpreter.
