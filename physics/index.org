* Overview

I will be working my way through a number of physics textbooks for
enjoyment. One of the books I hope to work my way through (even if
partially) is Kip Thorne and Roger Blanford's
{{{book-title(Modern Classical Physics)}}}.

Currently I'm reading Landau and Lifshitz's {{{book-title(Fluid Mechanics)}}}.
Like all prideful pseudo-academics, I use cryptic abbreviations, and
refer to Landau and Lifshitz as "L&L". I may split my time between that and
L&L's {{{book-title(Statistical Mechanics)}}}.

* Contents

- [[file:climate-models.org][Climate Models]] gives an overview of the field
- [[file:fluid-dynamics.org][Fluid Dynamics]] discusses the physics of fluids, which is critical
  to modeling the atmosphere and oceans.
