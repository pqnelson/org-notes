* Overview

I will be working my way through a number of physics textbooks for
enjoyment. One of the books I hope to work my way through (even if
partially) is Kip Thorne and Roger Blanford's
{{{book-title(Modern Classical Physics)}}}.

Currently I'm reading Landau and Lifshitz's {{{book-title(Fluid Mechanics)}}}.
(See what's on deck in my [[file:reading-list.org][reading list]].)
Like all prideful pseudo-academics, I use cryptic abbreviations, and
refer to Landau and Lifshitz as "L&L". I may split my time between that and
L&L's {{{book-title(Statistical Mechanics)}}}.

:END:

- [[file:climate/index.org][Climate Science]] for a rapid introduction, mostly a sequence of
  specific calculations
- [[file:fluid-mechanics.org][Fluid Mechanics]] discusses the physics of fluids, which is critical
  to modeling the atmosphere and oceans.
- [[file:landau/index.org][Reading notes on Landau and Lifshitz]]
- [[file:multiphysics.org][Multiphysics]] computer simulation of coupled physical systems
- [[file:data.org][Data]] for tables of compiled empirical measurements, for quick reference
- [[file:meta-physics.org][Meta-Physics]] for the conventions I've taken
