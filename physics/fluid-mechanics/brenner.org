Howard Brenner made a fascinating observation about fluid mechanics: the
derivation of the equations of motion rely on identifying the [Eulerian]
/mass velocity/ with the [Lagrangian] /volume velocity/,
despite the fact the former is kinematical whereas the latter is
dynamical. We can experimentally test this hypothesis, and Brenner *did*
that!

Unsurprisingly, these quantities are /different/. We end up with three
sets of equations:

1. Conservation of mass: $\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{D}}{\mathrm{D}t}\rho+\vec{u}_{m}\cdot\vec{\nabla}\rho=0$
2. Euler's equations: $\displaystyle\rho\frac{\mathrm{D}}{\mathrm{D}t}\vec{u}_{v} =-\vec{\nabla}p$
3. Constitutive equation: $\vec{u}_{v}-\vec{u}_{m}=K\nabla p$.

For incompressible fluids with small pressure differences, this behaves
the same as the Euler equations of motion.

*But* for compressible fluids with large pressure differences, the
behaviour is completely different.

For modeling the atmosphere of Earth in climate models, will the Brenner
equations of motion make a significant difference?

It turns out that these equations of motion behave more nicely than the
Euler equations of motion. Probably this carries over to the
Navier-Stokes equations. See:
