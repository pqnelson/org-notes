As usual in the sciences, examples are more important than principles.
There was a book by van Dyke, /An Album of Fluid Motion/. It would be
nice to turn that into a bunch of GIFs or Javascript widgets, where the
user could change the value of Reynolds numbers and other physical
parameters. (Curiously, it appears the Lattice Boltzmann method is the
preferred numerical method /de jour/.)

  bounded between two sheets or surfaces. We can study Hele-Shaw flows
  past cylinders, airfoils, etc.

- Is there some well-defined form of turbulence? See [[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/27805/is-there-a-mathematically-precise-definition-of-turbulence-for-solutions-of-navi][mathoverflow]].
