These are my reading notes of Landau and Lifshitz's {{{book-title(Fluid Mechanics)}}}
(vol.6 of their series on Theoretical Physics).

*A note on L&L's style.* It seems that Landau and Lifshitz write in a
manner that's the mirror opposite of abstract mathematics. Instead of
"theorem" and then "proof", they provide a "proof" followed by a
"theorem" (but do not announce it with a bold *Theorem* prefix).
Consequently, reading L&L amounts to trying to figure out what claims
are made in a section, then reconstructing the proof.

* Quickstart, Ideal Fluids

** Basic Quantities

Basically, the idea is to model "infinitesimal parcels" of a fluid,
so we think in terms of densities(?). Like, if we took out an
"infinitesimal microscope" in particle physics, a particle is a point.
But in fluid mechanics, it's a "Kool Aide man": a "container" of
infinitesimal volume of fluid. There are 5 quantities which
determine the state of a fluid:

- $\vec{v}$ the 3 components of the velocity vector for a fluid parcel
- $p$ fluid pressure
- $\rho$ mass density

We think of the velocity vector as a vector field parametrized by
time.

#+begin_remark
Landau and Lifshitz note the pressure and density, plus the
equations of state, determine the thermodynamics properties of the
fluid (L&L, vol.6, \sect1).
#+end_remark

*** Material Derivative

A recurring operator we'll use is the {{{define(Material Derivative)}}}
defined as

\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{D t} = \vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}.
\end{equation}

We can think of it as translating a time derivative in the frame of a
given fluid packet to the lab frame.

#+begin_exercise
Prove that the material derivative is linear

$$\frac{D}{Dt}(f + g) = \frac{Df}{Dt} + \frac{Dg}{Dt}$$
#+end_exercise

#+begin_exercise
Prove that the material derivative obeys the Leibniz rule

$$\frac{D}{Dt}(fg) = f\frac{Dg}{Dt}+\frac{Df}{Dt}g$$
#+end_exercise

#+begin_exercise
Prove that the material derivative obeys the chain rule

$$\frac{D}{Dt}(f\circ g) = (f'\circ g)\frac{Dg}{Dt}$$

What is $f'\circ g$ in this case?
#+end_exercise

*** Continuity Equation

The conservation of mass induces the {{{define(Continuity Equation)}}}:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\rho + \vec{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\vec{v}) = 0.
\end{equation}

** Euler's equations

From Newton's second law, we have $\rho \,\D\vec{v}/\D t = -\vec\nabla p$.
The derivative of the velocity vector, in this case, becomes the
material derivative since $\vec{v}=\vec{v}(\vec{x}(t), t)$ so the
total derivative is just $\partial_{t}\vec{v} + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec\nabla)\vec{v}$.
We also add the force of gravity $\rho \vec{g}$ to get
{{{define(Euler's equations)}}}, if we divide through by $\rho$

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\vec{v} + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec\nabla)\vec{v}
 = \frac{-1}{\rho}\vec\nabla p + \vec{g}.
\end{equation}

#+NAME: euler-equations-with-w
#+begin_remark
We often we will write Euler's equations as

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\vec{v} + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec\nabla)\vec{v}
 = -\vec{\nabla}w.
\end{equation}

#+end_remark

*** Adiabatic Fluids

Note we didn't consider viscosity in deriving this equation, we
just used Newton's second law modified for fluid packets (to give
us the material derivative of velocity as the
"acceleration"). Since we didn't consider viscosity, there is no
heat exchange between different parts of the fluid, nor between the
fluid and its environment.

#+begin_corollary
This absence of heat exchange between components of the fluid (and
between the fluid and its environment) implies the motion is
adiabatic throughout the fluid. As a consequence, the motion of an
ideal fluid must necessarily be supposed adabiatic.
#+end_corollary

L&L note in adiabatic motion, the entropy of any particle of fluid
remains constant as that particle moves around in space. So if $s$
denotes the entropy per unit mass, we can express the adabiatic
condition as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D s}{\D t} = \partial_{t}s + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec\nabla)s = 0.
\end{equation}

L&L refer to the quantity $\rho s\vec{v}$ as the
{{{define(Entropy Flux Density)}}} because we have the "equation of
continuity" for entropy in terms of it:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho s) + \vec{\nabla}\cdot(\rho s\vec{v}) = 0.
\end{equation}

*** Isentropic Fluids

If, "as usually happens", the entropy is constant throughout the
volume of the fluid at some initial instant, it retains everywhere
the same constant value at all times and for any subsequent motion
of the fluid. In this case we can write the adiabatic condition as

\begin{equation}
s = \mbox{constant}
\end{equation}

and L&L usually does so. In this case, such a motion is said to be
{{{define(Isentropic)}}}.

#+begin_puzzle
When will entropy *not* be constant throughout the fluid at some moment
in time?
#+end_puzzle

#+NAME: isentropy-euler-equations
#+begin_theorem
The Euler equations of motion for an isentropic fluid may be
rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\curl\vec{v}) = \curl(\vec{v}\times(\curl\vec{v})).
\end{equation}

which involves only the velocity.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_remark
This derivation of Euler's equations, and isentropic stuff, comes from L&L, vol.6, \sect2.
#+end_remark

*** Boundary Conditions for Euler's Equation

This requires some boundary condition. For an ideal fluid, this
boundary condition is simply "the fluid cannot penetrate a surface
solid". I.e., the component of the fluid velocity normal to the
bounding surface must vanish if that surface is at rest:

\begin{equation}
v_{\vec{n}} = 0.
\end{equation}

In general, for the case when the surface is moving, $v_{n}$ must
be equal to the corrsponding component of the velocity of the surface.

The next steps are to study this equation when the fluid is at rest
$\vec{v}=0$ (hydrostatics)
and when $\partial_{t}\vec{v}=0$ is constant (Bernoulli's law).

#+begin_remark
See also later discussions of boundary conditions [[*Back to the Equations of motion][(\sect10)]].
#+end_remark

** Hydrostatics

Consider a fluid at rest in a uniform gravitational field. Then
Euler's equation takes the form

\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla}p = \rho \vec{g}.
\end{equation}

This equation describes the mechanical equilibrium of the fluid.

#+NAME: mechanical-equilibrium
#+begin_definition
We say a fluid is in {{{define(Mechanical Equilibrium)}}} if it
exhibits no macroscopic motion. (L&L, vol.6, \sect4)
#+end_definition

#+begin_remark
If there are no external forces, then this equation becomes
$\vec{\nabla}p=0$ or equivalently $p = \mbox{constant}$. The
pressure is the same everywhere in the fluid.
#+end_remark

*** Case: Constant Density

When we have $\rho$ be constant throughout the fluid, we can solve
the simplified Euler's equation. Taking $z$ as the vertical axis,
so $\vec{g} = -g\widehat{z}$, then we have

\begin{equation}
\partial_{x}p = \partial_{y}p = 0
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\partial_{z} = -\rho g.
\end{equation}

Hence the general solution for this system of equations is

\begin{equation}
p = -\rho g z + \mbox{constant}.
\end{equation}

If further the fluid is at rest has a free surface at height $h$,
to which an external pressure $p_{0}$ (the same at every point) is
applied, this surface must be the horizontal plane $z = h$. From
the condition $p = p_{0}$ for $z = h$, we find the constant is
$p_{0} + \rho gh$, so in this case

\begin{equation}
p = p_{0} + \rho g(h - z).
\end{equation}

But again, this is the special case of a special case: when density
is constant.

*** Nonconstant Densities in Thermal Equilibrium

When our fluid is a gas, or we have large amounts of our liquid,
then we cannot approximate density as constant. This is especially
true for gases like the atmosphere.

But we may suppose the fluid is in mechanical and thermal
equilibrium. So the temperature is the same at every point. We use
the thermal relation

\begin{equation}
\D\Phi = -s\,\D T + V\,\D p
\end{equation}

where $\Phi$ is the thermodynamic potential (Gibbs free energy) per
unit mass. For constant temperature, this becomes

\begin{equation}
\D\Phi = V\,\D p = \frac{\D p}{\rho}.
\end{equation}

This let's us write

\begin{equation}
\frac{\vec{\nabla}p}{\rho} = \vec{\nabla}\Phi.
\end{equation}

Euler's equation then becomes

\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla}\Phi = \vec{g}.
\end{equation}

For a constant vector $\vec{g}$ directed along the negative
\(z\)-axis, we have

\begin{equation}
\vec{g}:=-\vec{\nabla}(gz)
\end{equation}

hence

\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla}(\Phi + gz) = 0,
\end{equation}

or equivalently

\begin{equation}
\Phi + gz = \mbox{constant}.
\end{equation}

#+begin_remark
Does this make sense? Well, $\Phi + gz = \mbox{constant}$ is known
to be the condition for thermodynamic equilirium of a system in an
external field. Good, recovering well-known results tell us we're
on the right track...or, we've been on the wrong track for such a
long time that we can't tell. At any rate, we're consistent, and
that's good.
#+end_remark

*** Consequence of Hydrostatic Condition: Mechanical Equilibrium Criteria

Particularly useful for me, when considering a fluid like the
atmosphere, which is in mechanical equilibrium in a gravitational
field, the pressure in it can be a function only of the
altitude/"height" $z$ (otherwise, if the pressure were different at
different points with the same altitude, motion would follow).

It follows then that the density

\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{-1}{g}\frac{\D p}{\D z}
\end{equation}

is also a function of $z$ only. The pressure and density determine
the temperature, which is therefore again a function of $z$
only. So in mechanical equilibrium in a gravitational field,
the pressure, density, and temperature distributions depend only on
the altitude.

Conversely, if, say, the temperature is different at different
points with the same altitude, then mechanical equilibrium is
impossible. (Thus this fact is useful in contrapositive form, too.)

*** For a large mass of self-gravitating Fluid

When we have a large mass of fluid, say a star, whose separate
parts are held together by gravitational attraction. Let $\phi$
be the Newtonian gravitational potential of the field due to the
fluid. It satisfies the differential equation

\begin{equation}
\nabla^{2}\phi = 4\pi G\rho
\end{equation}

where $G$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant. The
gravitational acceleration is $-\vec{\nabla}\phi$, and the force on
a mass $\rho$ is $-\rho\vec{\nabla}\phi$. The condition of
equilibrium is therefore

\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla}p = -\rho\vec{\nabla}\phi.
\end{equation}

Dividing both sides by $\rho$ then taking the divergence of both
sides gives us

\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}p\right) = -4\pi G\rho.
\end{equation}

This seems like a great deal more difficult. But we did not assume
thermodynamic equilibrium, and in exchange we have a condition for
mechanical equilibrium.

If we further assume the body is not rotating, then it will enjoy a
spherical symmetry when in equilibrium, and the density & pressure
distributions will be spherically symmetric. We have in spherical
coordinates our condition become

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^{2}}\frac{\D}{\D r}\left(\frac{r^{2}}{\rho}\frac{\D p}{\D r}\right) = -4\pi G\rho.
\end{equation}

Again, this fails to hold for a rotating body (like the Earth).

** On the "Absence of Convection" Condition

We've concluded from our discussion of hydrostatics that a fluid
can be in [[mechanical-equilibrium][mechanical equilibrium]] (i.e., exhibit no macroscopic motion)
without being in thermodynamic equilibrium. The hydrostatic
equation can be satisfied even if the temperature is not constant
throughout the fluid.

The question arises concerning the stability of such an
equilibrium. Unsurprisingly, the equilibrium is stable if
a condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, the equilibrium is /unstable/,
and this leads to the appearance in the fluid of currents which
tend to mix the fluid in such a way as to equalize the
temperature. This motion is called {{{define(Convection)}}}.

The condition for "mechanical equilibrium being stable" is "absence
of convection".

** Bernoulli's Equation

*** Steady Flows

#+begin_definition
By {{{define(Steady Flow)}}}, we mean one in which the velocity is
constant in time at any point occupied in the fluid. I.e.,
$\vec{v}$ is a function of the coordinates only, so that $\partial_{t}\vec{v}=0$.
#+end_definition

In a steady flow, the [[isentropy-euler-equations][isentropic Euler equations]] becomes

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\vec{\nabla}(v^{2}) - \vec{v}\times(\curl\vec{v}) = -\vec{\nabla}w.
\end{equation}

*** Streamlines

Streamlines are lines such that the tangent to a streamline at any
point gives the direction of the velocity of that point. They are
determined by the system of differential equations

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D x}{v_{x}} = \frac{\D y}{v_{y}} = \frac{\D z}{v_{z}}.
\end{equation}

#+begin_remark
This can be phrased differently, as the integral curve of the velocity
vector fields, i.e., as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D}{\D s}\varphi(s) = \vec{v}(\vec{x}(s), t)
\end{equation}

with initial condition $\varphi'(0) = \vec{v}(\vec{x}(0), t)$. The
$\varphi\colon[0,1]\to\RR^{3}$ is a streamline.
#+end_remark

In steady flow, the streamlines do not vary with time (i.e., the choice
of $t$ does not vary the solution of $\varphi$), and coincide
with the paths of the fluid particles.

*BUT* for non-steady flows, this coincidence no longer occurs: the
tangents to the streamlines give the directions of the velocities
of fluid particles at various points in space at a given instant,
where the tangents to the paths give the directions of the
velocities of given fluid particles at various times.

*Question:* for non-steady flows, are streamlines still a valuable
concept?

*** Bernoulli's Equation Derivation

Taking the equation for steady flows, then forming the scalar
product with the unit vector tangent to the streamline at each
point (call this unit vector $\vec{\ell}$). The projection of the
gradient on any direction is the derivative in that direction (duh,
the directional derivative). So

\begin{equation}
\vec{\ell}\cdot(\vec{\nabla}w) = \partial w/\partial\ell.
\end{equation}

The vector $\vec{v}\times(\curl\vec{v})$ is orthogonal
to $\vec{v}$, hence its dot product with $\vec{\ell}$ vanishes.

Thus we get the simplified equation

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\ell}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2} + w\right) = 0.
\end{equation}

It follows that $w + v^{2}/2$ is constant along the streamline, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}v^{2} + w = \mbox{constant}.
\end{equation}

This is precisely {{{define(Bernoulli's Equation)}}}.

In general, the constant $w + v^{2}/2$ takes different values for
different streamlines.

*** In a Gravitational Field

So, if our fluid flows in a gravitational field, the acceleration
$\vec{g}$ due to gravity must be added to the right-hand side of
the isentropic Euler equations for steady flows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\vec{\nabla}(v^{2}) - \vec{v}\times(\curl\vec{v}) = -\vec{\nabla}w + \vec{g}.
\end{equation}

Let us take the direction of gravity as the \(z\)-axis, with $z$
increasing upwards. This choice let's us relate the cosine of the
angle between $\vec{g}$ and $\vec{\ell}$ to be equal to the derivative
$-\D z/\D\ell$, so the projection of $\vec{g}$ on $\vec{\ell}$ is
$-g\,\D z/\D\ell$.

Then we have our projected equation become

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\ell}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2} + w + gz\right) = 0.
\end{equation}

Hence Bernoulli's equation states that along a streamline we have

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2} + w\right) = \mbox{constant}.
\end{equation}

** Energy Flux

*** Energy per unit volume

For our fluid, the energy per unit volume of fluid is
$\rho v^{2}/2 + \rho\varepsilon$ the sum of its kinetic energy and
internal energy, where $\varepsilon$ is internel energy per unit mass.

The change in this energy is given by its partial derivative with
respect to time.

*** Conservation Equation

#+begin_theorem
Assuming an adiabatic fluid, the conservation of energy implies

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v^{2}/2 + \rho\varepsilon)
 = -\nabla\cdot[\rho\vec{v}(v^{2}/2 + w)].
\end{equation}
#+end_theorem

This follows by computing $\partial_{t}(\rho v^{2}/2 + \rho\varepsilon)$,
the change in energy with respect to time. The first and second
terms are rather involved, and delegated to "lemmas" below. But the
lemmas then give us

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\left(\frac{\rho v^{2}}{2} + \rho\varepsilon\right)
= -\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2} + w\right)\vec{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\vec{v})
  -\rho\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla}(w + v^{2}/2)
\end{equation}

The right-hand side can be rewritten to give the final result.

**** Change of Kinetic Energy with respect to Time

To compute this quantity, we begin by considering the kinetic energy term

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v^{2}/2)
= \frac{v^{2}}{2}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}
  + \rho\vec{v}\cdot\frac{\partial\vec{v}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

Now we use the [[*Continuity Equation][continuity equation]] and equation of motion

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v^{2}/2) =
  \frac{-v^{2}}{2}\nabla\cdot(\rho\vec{v}) - \vec{v}\cdot(\vec{\nabla}p)
  - \rho\vec{v}\cdot\bigl((\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}\bigr).
\end{equation}

In the last term, we replace

\begin{equation}
\vec{v}\cdot\bigl((\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}\bigr)
 = \frac{1}{2}\vec{v}\cdot(\vec{\nabla}(v^{2}))
\end{equation}

and in the middle term (using the thermodynamic relation
$\D w = T\,\D s + (1/\rho)\D p$) we replace

\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla}p = \rho\vec{\nabla}w - \rho T\vec{\nabla}s
\end{equation}

thus obtaining

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v^{2}/2)
= \frac{-v^{2}}{2}\nabla\cdot(\rho\vec{v})
  - \rho\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla}(w + v^{2}/2)
  + \rho T\vec{v}\cdot(\vec{\nabla}s).
\end{equation}

**** Change of Internal Energy with respect to Time

Now we compute $\partial_{t}(\rho\varepsilon)$, we use the
thermodynamic relation

\begin{equation}
\D\varepsilon = T\,\D s - p\,\D V
 = T\,\D s + \frac{p}{\rho^{2}}\D\rho.
\end{equation}

Since $\varepsilon + p/\rho = \varepsilon + pV$ is the heat
function $w$ per unit mass, we find

\begin{equation}
\D(\rho\varepsilon) = \varepsilon\,\D \rho + \rho\,\D \varepsilon
= w\,\D \rho + \rho T\,\D s.
\end{equation}

Thus (using the general adiabatic equation of motion)

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho\varepsilon) = w\partial_{t}\rho + \rho T\partial_{t}s
 = -w\vec{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\vec{v}) - \rho T\vec{v}\cdot(\vec{\nabla}s).
\end{equation}

*** Meaning of the Conservation Equation

We have an abstract equation we assert is correct through a long
string of equations. Believe me? Well, let's see what it
/means/. We need to integrate it over some volume $V$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\int\left(\frac{\rho v^{2}}{2} + \rho\varepsilon\right)\,\D V
 = -\int\vec{\nabla}\cdot\left[\rho\vec{v}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2}+w\right)\right]\,\D V
\end{equation}

We convert the integral on the right to a surface integral

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\int\left(\frac{\rho v^{2}}{2} + \rho\varepsilon\right)\D V
= -\oint\left[\rho\vec{v}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2}+w\right)\right]\cdot \D\vec{f}.
\end{equation}

- The LHS is the rate of change of the energy of the fluid in some volume.
- The RHS is the amount of energy flowing out of this volume in
  unit time.
- We may call $\rho\vec{v}(w + v^{2}/2)$ the {{{define(Energy Flux Density)}}}.
  Its magnitude is the amount of energy passing in unit time
  through unit area perpendicular to the direction of the
  velocity. Nifty.

#+begin_remark
The expression $\rho\vec{v}(w + v^{2}/2)$ shows any unit mass of
fluid carries with it during its motion an amount of energy $w+v^{2}/2$.
The fact that the heat function $w$ appears here, and not the
internal energy $\varepsilon$, has physical significance. Putting
$w=\varepsilon + p/\rho$, we can write the flux of energy through a
closed surface in the form

\begin{equation}
-\oint\rho\vec{v}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2}+\varepsilon\right)\cdot\D\vec{f}
-\oint p\vec{v}\cdot\D\vec{f}
\end{equation}

The first term is the energy (kinetic and internal) transported
through the surface in unit time by the mass of fluid. The second
term is the work done by pressure forces on the fluid within the
surface.
#+end_remark

** Momentum Flux

(*Note:* the "correct" indices would be $\Pi^{ik}$. And this is the
stress-energy tensor's spatial components, for a perfect fluid.)

*** Derivation of Momentum Flux Density Tensor

The momentum of unit volume is $\rho\vec{v}$. What is its rate of
change with respect to time $\partial_{t}(\rho\vec{v})$? We will
switch to index notation for ease of computation.

We can use the product rule to find

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho v_{i})
= \rho\frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}v_{i}
\end{equation}

We can use the [[*Continuity Equation][continuity equation]] in the form of

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\rho = -\sum_{k}\frac{\partial(\rho v_{k})}{\partial x_{k}}
\end{equation}

and Euler's equations in the form of

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}v_{i} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}}
 - \sum_{k}v_{k}\frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{k}}
\end{equation}

to obtain

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v_{i})
 = \rho\left(-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}} - \sum_{k}v_{k}\frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{k}}\right)
 + \left(-\sum_{k}\frac{\partial(\rho v_{k})}{\partial x_{k}}\right) v_{i}
\end{equation}

which simplifies to

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v_{i})
 = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}} - \sum_{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{k}}(\rho v_{i}v_{k}).
\end{equation}

The first term on the right hand side can be rewritten using index
gymnastics as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}}
 = \sum_{k}\delta_{ik}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{k}}.
\end{equation}

Then we have

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\rho v_{i})
 = -\sum_{k}\frac{\partial\Pi_{ik}}{\partial x_{k}}
\end{equation}

where the tensor $\Pi_{ik}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
\Pi_{ik} = p\delta_{ik} + \rho v_{i}v_{k}.
\end{equation}

Since $\Pi_{ik}$ is the sum of two symmetric tensors, it is thus a
symmetric tensor.

**** Momentum Flux Density Tensor

We define the tensor $\Pi_{ik}$ as the {{{define(Momentum Flux Density Tensor)}}}:

\begin{equation}
\Pi_{ik} = p\delta_{ik} + \rho v_{i}v_{k}.
\end{equation}

*** Its interpretation

We grasp the meaning of the momentum flux density tensor by looking
at its integral over some volume

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\int \rho v_{i}\,\D V
 = -\int\sum_{k}\frac{\partial\Pi_{ik}}{\partial x_{k}}\,\D V.
\end{equation}

We can apply Green's theorem to the right hand side, obtaining

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\int \rho v_{i}\,\D V
= -\sum_{k}\oint\Pi_{ik}\,\D f_{k}.
\end{equation}

- The left-hand side is the rate of change of the \(i\)-th component of
  momentum contained in the volume (i.e., the domain of integration).
- The RHS is thus the amount of momentum flowing out through the
  bounding surface in unit time.

So $\Pi_{ik}\,\D f^{k}$ is the \(i\)-th component of momentum flowing
through the surface element $\D f$. If we write $\D f_{k}$ in the form
of $n_{k}\,\D f$, where $\D f$ is the area of the surface element and
$\vec{n}$ is a unit vector along the outward normal, we find that
$\Pi_{ik}n^{k}$ is the flux of the \(i\)-th component of momentum
through unit surface area. Note that

\begin{equation}
\Pi_{ik}n^{k} = p n_{i} + \rho v_{i}v_{k}n^{k}.
\end{equation}

or in vector form

\begin{equation}
\Pi\vec{n} = p\vec{n} + \rho\vec{v}(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{n}).
\end{equation}

** Conservation of Circulation

#+NAME: velocity-circulation
#+begin_definition
The integral

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \oint \vec{v}\cdot \D\vec{\ell}
\end{equation}

along some closed contour is called the {{{define(Velocity Circulation)}}}
around that contour.
#+end_definition

#+NAME: kelvin-thm
#+begin_theorem
In an ideal fluid, the velocity circulation round a closed "fluid"
contour is constant in time.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_proof
We compute the time-derivative of the velocity circulation

\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{D t}\oint \vec{v}\cdot\D r
= \oint\frac{D\vec{v}}{D t}\cdot\D r + \oint\vec{V}\cdot\frac{D}{D t}\D r
\end{equation}

We use the identity

\begin{equation}
\vec{v}\cdot\frac{D}{D t}\D\vec{r} = \vec{v}\cdot\D\frac{D r}{D t}=\D(v^{2}/2)
\end{equation}

And the fact that the contour integral of a total differential along a
closed curve vanishes (i.e., is zero). This leaves us

\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{D t}\oint\vec{v}\cdot\D{\vec{r}}
= \oint\frac{D\vec{v}}{D t}\cdot\D\vec{r}.
\end{equation}

Using [[euler-equations-with-w][Euler's equations]]

\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{D t}\vec{v} = -\vec{\nabla}w,
\end{equation}

we obtain

\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{D t}\oint\vec{v}\cdot\D{\vec{r}}
 = \oint(-\vec{\nabla}w)\cdot\D\vec{r}.
\end{equation}

Now we use Stoke's theorem

\begin{equation}
\oint(-\vec{\nabla}w)\cdot\D\vec{r}
 = \iint\curl(\vec{\nabla}w)\cdot\D\vec{A}.
\end{equation}

But the right-hand side vanishes, so

\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{D t}\oint\vec{v}\cdot\D{\vec{r}} = 0.
\end{equation}

Thus we have Kelvin's theorem.
#+end_proof

#+begin_corollary
We have from Kelvin's theorem,

\begin{equation}
\oint \vec{v}\cdot\D\vec{l} = \mbox{constant}.
\end{equation}
#+end_corollary

#+NAME: defn-vorticity
#+begin_definition
We refer to the quantity $\curl\vec{v}$ (the curl of the
velocity vector field) as the {{{define(Vorticity)}}} of the field.
#+end_definition

Our intuition should think of the corollary to Kelvin's theorem as
saying "The vorticity moves with the fluid".

#+begin_exercise

** Potential Flow

*Case 1: Steady Flow.* Consider a steady flowing fluid.
Consider a point on a streamline where the vorticity vanishes
$\curl\vec{v}=0$. We draw an infinitesimal circle around
that point, and move the circle with the point over time. The claim is
the vorticity in the circle remains constant (by Kelvin's theorem) and
moreover every point on the streamline has the same vorticity.

*Case 2: Non-steady Flow.*
Now consider a fluid which is not steady. The same argument holds,
except we work with the infinitesimal contour moving around the
trajectory of a fluid parcel. (This is because streamlines do not
coincide with trajectories in non-steady flowing fluids.)

#+begin_puzzle
Observe we are assuming we can always draw a closed contour around
every point of a streamline. Is this a valid assumption to make?
#+end_puzzle

#+begin_definition
A flow for which $\curl\vec{v}=0$ for every point in the
flow is called a {{{define(Potential Flow)}}} or
{{{define(Irrotational Flow)}}}; otherwise, it is called a
{{{define(Rotational Flow)}}}.
#+end_definition

*** Tenative Results for Non-Steady Flows

We may be excited and hope to base several arguments upon this
non-steady flow result. For example...

- Consider steady flow past some body. Let the incident flow be uniform
  at infinity. Its velocity $\vec{v}$ is a constant (so
  $\curl\vec{v}=0$ on all streamlines). Hence we conclude
  that $\curl\vec{v}=0$ along the whole of every streamline
  (i.e., all of space).
- Suppose at some instant we have irrotational flow throughout the
  volume of the fluid. Then the velocity circulation around any closed
  contour in the fluid is zero.
  + *Simplifying Assumption.* (For simplicity, we assume the fluid
    occupies a simply-connected region of space; for a
    multiply-connected region, we need restrictions on the choice of
    contours for this derivation to work.)
  + *Thus* we then conclude this will hold at any future instant, i.e.,
    we should find that --- if there is potential flow at some instant,
    then there is potential flow at all subsequent instants. (In
    particular, any flow for which the fluid is initially at rest must
    be a potential flow.)
  + This is in accordance with the fact if $\curl\vec{v}=0$,
    then the [[isentropy-euler-equations][isentropic Euler equations]] hold automatically.

*** Limited Validity of these "Results"

Alas, these conclusions are of limited validity. Why? The proof given
above that $\curl\vec{v} = 0$ all along a streamline is, strictly
speaking, invalid for a line which lies in the surface of a solid body
past which the flow takes place, since the present of this surface makes
it impossible to draw a closed contour in the fluid encircling such a
streamline.

The equations of motion for an ideal fluid admit solutions for which
{{{define(separation)}}} occurs at the surface of the boundary: the
streamlines follow the surface, until the surface ends, and the
streamlines become separated and continue into the fluid. The resulting
flow pattern is characterized by the presence of a {{{define(Surface of Discontinuity)}}}
proceeding from the body. On this surface, the fluid velocity --- which
is everywhere tangential to the surface --- has a discontinuity. In
other words, at this surface one layer of fluid "slides" on another.
(Mathematically speaking, the discontinuity in the tangential velocity
components corresponds to a surface on which the curl of the velocity is
nonzero.)

#+CAPTION: An example of surfaces of discontinuity.
[[../img/fluid-0.png]]

When we include discontinuous flows, there are infinitely many solutions
to the equations of motion for an ideal fluid. The tangential
discontinuities are absolutely unstable and become turbulent and, well,
all hell breaks loose.

But when we, e.g., spray an object with water, there /is/ some flow,
i.e., empirically there /is/ a solution. What's going on here? Well,
water isn't an ideal fluid, there's some viscosity. Even if we had some
hypothetical ideal fluid, we would expect similar results. Why? Because
the properties of the flow in the {{{define(boundary layer)}}}
determines the choice of solution.

In the general case of flow past bodies of arbitrary form, solutions
with separation must be taken, which in turn results in turbulence.

For certain special shapes, the flow differs little from irrotational
flow. Well, it will be irrotational flow except in a thin layer of fluid
at the surface of the body and in a relatively narrow "wake" behind the
body. Nifty.

*** Another Case of Potential Flow

Another important case of potential flow occurs for small oscillations
of a body immersed in fluid. (Isn't the Earth immersed in its
atmosphere?) We can show that, if the amplitude $a$ of the oscillations
is small in comparison with the linear dimension $\ell$ of the body ($a\ll
\ell$), then the flow past the body will be potential flow. How to prove
it?

We estimate the order of magntidue of the various terms in Euler's
equation

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\vec{v} + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v} = -\vec{\nabla}w.
\end{equation}

The velocity $\vec{v}$ changes markedly over a distance of the order of
dimension $\ell$ of the body by an amount of the same order as the
velocity $\vec{u}_{\text{osc}}$ of the oscillating body. Hence:

- the derivatives of $\vec{v}$ with respect to the coordinates $\nabla\vec{v}\sim\bigOh(u/\ell)$;
- the order of $\vec{v}$ at fairly small distances from the body is $\vec{v}\sim\bigOh(\vec{u})$
- hence $(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}\sim\bigOh(u^{2}/\ell)$
- the derivative $\partial_{t}\vec{v}\sim\omega u$ where $\omega$ is the
  frequency of oscillations
  + since $\omega\sim u/a$ we have $\partial_{t}\vec{v} = u^{2}/a$
- since $a\ll\ell$, the term $(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}$ is
  small compared to $\partial_{t}\vec{v}$
  + hence we may neglect $(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}$
- the equation of motion becomes
  \begin{equation}
  \partial_{t}\vec{v} = -\vec{\nabla}w
  \end{equation}
- taking the curl of both sides, we obtain $\partial_{t}(\curl\vec{v})=0$
  + hence $\curl\vec{v} = \mbox{constant}$.
  + In oscillatory motion, the time average of the velocity vanishes;
    hence $\curl\vec{v} = 0$.
- Thus the motion of a fluid executing small oscillations is potential
  flow, to first approximation.

*** General Properties of Potential Flow

- Only isentropic flow can be potential flow (otherwise, for
  non-isentropic flow, if we have potential flow at some instant, the
  vorticity will be nonzero at subsequent instants, leading to
  non-potential ["rotational"] flow)
- In potential flow, the velocity circulation along /any/ closed contour
  vanishes $\oint \vec{v}\cdot\D\ell = \iint\curl\vec{v}\cdot\D\vec{f}=0$
  + Hence closed streamlines cannot exist in potential flow.
- In rotational flow, the velocity circulation is not zero in general.
  + There may be closed streamlines in rotational flow, but the presence
    of closed streamlines is not necessary for rotational flow.
- We could write the velocity as the gradient of a {{{define(Velocity Potential)}}}
  and denote it $\phi$,
  \begin{equation}
  \vec{v} = \vec{\nabla}\phi
  \end{equation}
  + The isentropic Euler equations become
    \begin{equation}
    \vec{\nabla}(\partial_{t}\phi + \frac{v^{2}}{2} + w) = 0.
    \end{equation}
  + The first integral of this equation looks like
    \begin{equation}
    \partial_{t}\phi + \frac{v^{2}}{2} + w = f(t)
    \end{equation}
    where $f(t)$ is "an arbitrary function of time". We may set it equal
    to zero without loss of generality (because the velocity potential
    is not uniquely defined: it's defined such that $\vec{v}$ is a
    spatial derivative of $\phi$, so adding any function of time to
    $\phi$ will produce the same results)
  + For steady flows, $\partial_{t}\phi = 0$, $f(t)$ is constant, and
    the first integral becomes Bernoulli's equation
    \begin{equation*}
    0 + \frac{v^{2}}{2} + w = \mbox{constant}.
    \end{equation*}
  + In general, the "constant" on the right hand side is a constant
    /along any given streamline/, but varies for different streamlines.
  + In a potential flow, it is constant throughout the fluid. This
    enhances the importance of Bernoulli's equation in the study of
    potential flow.

#+begin_remark
The velocity potential $\phi$ was first introduced by Euler. Thank God
Laplace invented his equation, or else we'd have yet another Euler's
equation.
#+end_remark

** Incompressible Fluids
# 29

#+begin_definition
Many cases, for the flow of liquids (and sometimes for gases), their
density may be supposed invariable (i.e., constant throughout the volume
of the fluid and throughout its motion). That is to say, there is no
noticeable compression or expansion of the fluid in such cases. We call
such situations {{{define(Incompressible Flow)}}}.
#+end_definition

Euler's equations greatly simplify for an incompressible fluid. Believe
me? (No...) OK, if we take $\rho$ constant, then...uh...well, we can
take it under the gradient:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\vec{v} + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}
 = -\vec{\nabla}(p/\rho) + \vec{g}.
\end{equation}

See? Completely different! OK, maybe not, so...well, the equation of
continuity, aha, /that/ simplifies greatly to:

\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v} = 0.
\end{equation}

Now /that/ is simple.

*** Equations of Motion

The equations of motion take advantage of the identity

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\vec{\nabla}v^{2} = \vec{v}\times(\curl\vec{v}) + (\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{v}
\end{equation}

and we can rewrite the equations of motion using this, and the
continuity equation, to be

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}(\curl\vec{v}) = \curl(\vec{v}\times(\curl\vec{v})).
\end{equation}

We don't need isentropy, we have the same equations of motion though.

*** Bernoulli's Equation

Bernoulli's equation simplifies for an incompressible fluid. We simply
replace the heat function $w$ by $p/\rho$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}v^{2} + \frac{p}{\rho} + gz = \mbox{constant}.
\end{equation}

*** Energy Flux

For an incompressible fluid, we also write $p/\rho$ in place of $w$ for
the energy flux as

\begin{equation}
\rho\vec{v}\left(\frac{1}{2}v^{2} + \frac{p}{\rho}\right).
\end{equation}

*** Back to the Equations of motion

Did you notice that the equations of motion are satisfied if

\begin{equation}
\curl\vec{v} = 0.
\end{equation}

Indeed, $\vec{v} = \vec{\nabla}\phi$ substituted into the continuity
equation gives us

\begin{equation}
\nabla^{2}\phi = 0.
\end{equation}

We need boundary conditions at the surfaces where the fluid meets solid
bodies. At fixed surfaces, the fluid velocity component $v_{n}$ normal
to the surface must be zero, whereas for moving surfaces it must be
equal to the normal components of the velocity of the surface (i.e., a
given function of time). The velocity $v_{n}$ is equal to the normal
derivative of the potential $\phi$:

\begin{equation}
v_{n} = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n}.
\end{equation}

Thus the general boudnary conditions are that $\partial\phi/\partial n$
is a given function of coordinates and time at the boundaries.

*** Irrotational ("Potential") Flow

For potential flow, the velocity is related to the pressure by results
from the previous section [[*General Properties of Potential Flow][(\sect9)]]. In an incompressible fluid, we can
replace $w$ in this equation by $p/\rho$

\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}\phi + \frac{v^{2}}{2} + \frac{p}{\rho} = f(t).
\end{equation}

We may notice here the following important property of potential flow of
an incompressible flow:

Suppose some solid body is moving through the fluid. If the result is
potential flow, it depends at any instant only on the velocity of the
moving body at that instant, and not (e.g.) on its acceleration. Since
$\nabla^{2}\phi=0$ does not explicitly contain time, which enter the
solution only through the boundary conditions, and these contain only
the velocity of the moving body.

*** Stagnation Point

Consider a fluid flowing past a body, as diagrammed in the next figure.
For Bernoulli's equation $v^{2}/2 + p/\rho$ equal to some constant, we
see in steady flow of an incompressible fluid (not in a gravitational
field), the greatest pressure occurs where velocity is zero. Such a
point usually occurs on the surface of a body past which the fluid is
flowing and is called a {{{define(Stagnation Point)}}}. If $\vec{u}$ is
the velocity of the incident current (= the fluid velocity at infinity),
and $p_{0}$ is the pressure at infinity, then the pressure at the
stagnation point is

\begin{equation}
p_{\text{max}} = p_{0} + \frac{\rho u^{2}}{2}.
\end{equation}

#+CAPTION: An example of a stagnation point $S$.
[[../img/fluid-1.png]]

*** Planar Flow for Incompressible Fluids of Constant Density

#+begin_definition
If the velocity distribution in a moving fluid depends on only two
coordinates (say, $x$ and $y$), and if the velocity is everywhere
parallel to the \(xy\)-plane, then the flow is said to be {{{define(Two-Dimensional)}}}
or {{{define(Plane Flow)}}}.
#+end_definition

To solve problems of two-dimensional flow of an incompressible fluid, it
is sometimes convenient to express the velocity in terms of what is
called the {{{define(Stream Function)}}}. From the equation of
continuity

$$ \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v}=\partial_{x}v_{x} +\partial_{y}v_{y}=0 $$

we see the velocity components can be written as derivatives

\begin{equation}
v_{x} = \partial_{y}\psi,\quad\mbox{and}\quad
v_{y} = -\partial_{x}\psi
\end{equation}

of some function $\psi(x,y)$ called the {{{define(Stream Function)}}}.
The equation of continuity is satisfied automatically, if we write the
velocity in this manner (prove this to yourself).

#+begin_remark
The critical property for the existence of stream functions is that we
are working with 2-dimensional problems, *not* that we're working in a
potential flow.
#+end_remark

The equation that must be satisfied now: the equation of motion. Simply
plug in the definition of velocity as the derivative of the
streamfunction into the equations of motion to find:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla^{2}\psi
 - \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\nabla^{2}\psi
 + \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\nabla^{2}\psi
= 0.
\end{equation}

Now, if we know the stream function, we can immediately determine the
streamlines of steady flow. The differential equation for stream lines
are

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D x}{v_{x}}=\frac{\D y}{v_{y}}\implies v_{y}\,\D x - v_{x}\,\D y=0.
\end{equation}

This expresses the fact that the direction of the tangent to a
streamline is the direction of the velocity. Substituting the definition
of velocity components as the derivative of the stream function

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\D x + \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\D y=\D\psi=0,
\end{equation}

hence $\psi$ is constant. Thus the streamlines are the family of curves
obtained by putting the stream function $\psi(x,y)$ equal to an
arbitrary constant (aren't these the "level curves" we learned about
back in calculus?).

*** Mass Flux Across a curve

If we draw a curve between two points $A$ and $B$ in the \(xy\)-plane,
the mass flux $Q$ across this curve is given by the differencein the
values of the stream function at these two points regardless of the
curve. If $v_{n}$ is the component of the velocity normal to the curve
at any point, we have

\begin{equation}
Q = \rho \oint_{A}^{B}v_{n}\,\D\ell = \rho \oint^{B}_{A}(-v_{y}\,\D x +
v_{x}\,\D y) = \rho\int^{B}_{A}\D\psi
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
Q = \rho(\psi_{B} - \psi_{A}).
\end{equation}

*** Methods of Solving Two-Dimensional Irrotational Flow

We can use complex analysis to solve a lot of problems of
two-dimensional potential flow of incompressible fluids past bodies of
various shapes. Look at the relation between the components of velocity
and the stream function:

\begin{equation*}
v_{x}=\partial_{x}\phi = \partial_{y}\psi,
\end{equation*}

and

\begin{equation*}
v_{y}=\partial_{y}\phi = -\partial_{x}\psi.
\end{equation*}

These are the Cauchy--Riemann equations for the complex expression

\begin{equation}
w = \phi + \I\psi
\end{equation}

to be an analytic function of the complex argument $z = x + \I y$. The
function $w$ is called the {{{define(Complex Potential)}}} and $\D w/\D z$
the {{{define(Complex Velocity)}}}. The modulus of this complex velocity
give the magnitude $v$ of the velocity and the angle $\theta$ between
the direction of the velocity and the \(x\)-axis:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\D w}{\D z} = v\E^{-\I\theta}.
\end{equation}

At a solid surface past which the flow takes place, the velocity must be
along the tangent; i.e., the profile contour of the surface must be a
streamline (i.e., $\psi$ is constant along it). The constant may be
taken to be zero, then the problem of flow past a given contour reduces
to determining an analytic function $w(z)$ which takes real values on
the contour.

The integral of an analytic function around any closed contour $C$ is
known to be $2\pi\I$ times the sum of residues of the function at its
simple poles inside $C$. Hence

\begin{equation}
\oint w'\,\D z = 2\pi\I\sum_{k}\mathrm{Res}(w', z_{k})
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{Res}(w', z_{k})$ are the residues of the complex velocity.
We also have

\begin{align*}
\oint w'\,\D z
&= \oint(v_{x} - \I v_{y})(\D x + \I\,\D y)\\
&= \oint(v_{x}\,\D x + v_{y}\,\D y) + \I\oint(v_{x}\,\D y - v_{y}\,\D x).
\end{align*}

The real part of this is just the velocity circulation $\Gamma$ around
the contour $C$. The imaginary part, multipled by $\rho$, is the mass
flux across $C$. If there are no sources of fluid within the contour,
this flux is zero and we then have

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = 2\pi\I\sum_{k}\mathrm{Res}(w', z_{k})
\end{equation}

all the residues are in this case purely imaginary.

*** ...and when /is/ the Fluid Incompressible?

Let us consider the conditions which the fluid may be regarded as
incompressible. When the pressure changes adiabatically by $\Delta p$,
the density changes by $\Delta\rho = (\partial\rho/\partial p)\Delta p$.

According to Bernoulli's equation, however, the order of $\Delta p\sim\rho v^{2}$
in steady flow. (L&L promises to show in \sect 64 that the derivative
$(\partial p/\partial\rho)$ is the square of the velocity of sound $c$
in the fluid, so $\Delta p\sim\rho v^{2}/c^{2}$.)

The fluid may be regarded as incompressible if

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}\ll 1.
\end{equation}

We see a necessary condition for this is the fluid velocity may be
regarded as small compared to that of sound:

\begin{equation}
v\ll c.
\end{equation}

But this is for a steady flow. What do we do for a non-steady flow? We
need an additional condition.

- Let $\tau$ and $\ell$ be a time and length of the order of the times and
  distances over which the fluid velocity undergoes significant changes.
- If $\partial_{t}\vec{v}$ and $(1/\rho)\vec{\nabla}p$ in Euler's
  equation are comparable, then we find the orders of magnitude
  $v/\tau\sim\Delta p/\ell\rho$ or $\Delta p\sim \ell\rho v/\tau$
- The corresponding change in $\rho$ is $\Delta\rho\sim\ell\rho v/\tau c^{2}$.
- In the equation of continuity, compare the terms $\partial_{t}\rho$
  and $\rho\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v}$, we find that $\partial_{t}\rho$
  may be neglected if $\Delta\rho/\tau\ll\rho v/\ell$, or
  \begin{equation}
  \tau\gg\ell/c.
  \end{equation}
- This has the meaning: the time $\ell/c$ taken by a sound signal to
  traverse the distance $\ell$ must be small compared to the time $\tau$
  during which the flow changes appreciably, so the propagation of
  interactions in the fluid may be regarded as instantaneous.
- If *both* this condition $\tau\gg\ell/c$ and our previous condition $v\ll c$
  are fulfilled, the fluid may be regarded as incompressible.

** Drag force in potential flow past a body
# 38

Consider the problem of irrotational flow of an incompressible ideal
fluid past some solid body. (Of course, this is the same problem as the
motion of a fluid when the same body moves through it...just change
coordinates in which the fluid is at rest at infinity.)

The potential flow for an incompressible fluid satisfies Laplace's
equation

\begin{equation}
\nabla^{2}\phi=0.
\end{equation}

The boundary condition is that the solutions vanish at infinity (since
the fluid is at rest). The origin is somewhere in the moving body: the
coordinate system moves with the body.

*** General Solution

The general form of Laplace's equation is

\begin{equation}
\phi=\frac{-a}{r}+\vec{A}\cdot\vec{\nabla}\frac{1}{r}+\bigOh(r^{-3})
\end{equation}

where $a$, $\vec{A}$ are independent of coordinates.

#+begin_proposition
The constant $a$ must be zero.
#+end_proposition

#+begin_proof
Suppose $\phi=-a/r$. Then the velocity is $\vec{v}=-\vec{\nabla}(a/r)=a\vec{r}/r^{3}$.
What is the mass flux through some closed surface (say a sphere with
radius $R$)? On this surface the velocity is constant and equal to
$a/R^{2}$. The total flux though it is therefore$\rho(a/R^{2})4\pi R^{2}=4\pi\rho a$.
But the flux of an incompressible fluid through any closed surface must
be zero. Hence $a=0$.
#+end_proof

Since we are seeking the velocity at large distances, the terms of
higher order than quadratic may be neglected, so we have

\begin{equation}
\phi = \vec{A}\cdot\vec{\nabla}(1/r)=-\vec{A}\cdot\widehat{r}/r^{2}
\end{equation}

and the velocity vector is

\begin{equation}
\vec{v}=(A\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{\nabla}\frac{1}{r}
=\frac{3(\vec{A}\cdot\widehat{r})\widehat{r}-\vec{A}}{r^{3}}
\end{equation}

where $\widehat{r}$ is a unit vector in the direction of $\vec{r}$.
At large distances the velocity diminishes as $r^{-3}$. The vector
$\vec{A}$ depends on the shape and velocity of the body and can be
determined only by solving the equation $\nabla^{2}\phi=0$ at all
distances, taking into account the appropriate boundary conditions at
the surface of the moving body.

*** Total Energy
# 39--40

#+begin_lemma
The internal energy of an incompressible fluid is constant.
#+end_lemma

#+begin_theorem
The total energy of the fluid is

\begin{equation*}
E = \frac{\rho}{2}(4\pi\vec{A}\cdot\vec{u}-V_{0}u^{2}),
\end{equation*}

where $\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the body, $V_{0}$ is the volume of
the body, $\vec{v}$ the velocity of the fluid, and $\vec{A}$ depends on
the shape of the body.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_proof
- The total kinetic energy for the fluid is $\frac{1}{2}\int\rho v^{2}\,\D V$
  where we integrate over all space /outside/ the body.
- Take a region of space /V/ bounded by a "large sphere" of radius $R$,
  centered at the origin. (We'll first integrate over the sphere, then
  take the $R\to\infty$ limit.)
- We have
  $$ \int v^{2}\,\D V = \int u^{2}\,\D V + \int(\vec{v}+\vec{u})\cdot(\vec{v}-\vec{u})\D V $$
  where $\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the body.
  + Since $\vec{u}$ is independent of the coordinates, the first
    integral on the RHS is simply $u^{2}(V-V_{0})$ where $V_{0}$ is the
    volume of the body.
  + In the second integral, we rewrite the factor $\vec{v}+\vec{u} = \vec{\nabla}(\phi+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})$
  + The equation of continuity tells us $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v}=0$
  + We have $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=0$
- We have
  $$ \int v^{2}\,\D V = u^{2}(V-V_{0}) + \int\vec{\nabla}\cdot[(\phi+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})(\vec{v}-\vec{u})] \D{V} $$
- The second integral can be transformed into a surface integral over
  the sphere's surface $S$ and the body's surface $S_{0}$.
  $$ \int\vec{\nabla}\cdot[(\phi+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})(\vec{v}-\vec{u})] \D{V} = \oint_{S_{0}}(\phi+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})(\vec{v}-\vec{u})\cdot\D\vec{A} + \oint_{S}(\phi+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})(\vec{v}-\vec{u})\cdot\D\vec{A} $$
  + On the surface $S_{0}$, the normal components of $\vec{v}$ and
    $\vec{u}$ are equal (due to boundary conditions).
  + Since the integration would be along the normal to the surface, the
    surface integral over $S_{0}$ vanishes.
- We work over the surface integral over $S$, substituting the
  expression $\vec{v} = (\vec{A}\cdot\vec{\nabla})\vec{\nabla}(1/r)$.
  Ignoring terms which vanish as $R\to\infty$, integrating over the
  sphere of radius $R$ with $\D\vec{A} = \widehat{n}R^{2}\D\Omega$ where
  $\D\Omega$ is an element of the solid angle, this gives us

\begin{equation}
\oint_{S}(\phi+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r})(\vec{v}-\vec{u})\cdot\D\vec{A}
= \int[3(\vec{A}\cdot\widehat{n})(\vec{u}\cdot\widehat{n}) - (\vec{u}\cdot\widehat{n})^{2}R^{3}]\D\Omega
\end{equation}

- Performing this integral, multiplying by $\rho/2$, we obtain the
  expression for the total energy of the fluid
  $$ E = \frac{\rho}{2}(4\pi\vec{A}\cdot\vec{u} - V_{0}u^{2}). $$
#+end_proof

#+begin_remark
The integral we must perform in the last step is taken over a sphere,
and since the integrands are constant, it amounts to multiplying by
$4\pi R^{3}/3$.
#+end_remark

#+NAME: defn-induced-mass-tensor
#+begin_definition
We can rewrite the energy $E$ just computed as a quadratic function of
the components of $\vec{u}$ as

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{2}m_{ik}u^{i}u^{k}
\end{equation}

where $m_{ik}$ is a constant, symmetric tensor, called the
{{{define(Induced-Mass Tensor)}}}. Its components can be computed from
those of $\vec{A}$.
#+end_definition

*** D'Alembert's Paradox

We can compute the total momentum $\vec{P}$ for the fluid from the
energy. How?

#+begin_lemma
Observe an infinitesimal change in $E$ and $\vec{P}$ are
related by

\begin{equation*}
\D E = \vec{u}\cdot\D\vec{P}.
\end{equation*}

#+end_lemma

#+begin_proof
- Assume the body accelerated by some external force $\vec{F}$
- Then the momentum of the fluid will be increased by $\D\vec{P}$ during
  the period $\D t$
- Then $\D\vec{P} = \vec{F}\,\D t$
- Hence $\vec{u}\cdot\D\vec{P} = \vec{u}\cdot\vec{F}\,\D t$ by scalar
  multiplication with $\vec{u}$ (i.e., the work done by force $\vec{F}$
  acting through the distance $\vec{u}\,\D t$, which in turn must be
  equal to the increase $\D E$ in the energy of the fluid)
#+end_proof

It follows from the definition of [[defn-induced-mass-tensor][induced mass tensor]] that

\begin{equation}
P_{i} = m_{ik}u^{k}.
\end{equation}

And by comparing results we find

\begin{equation}
\vec{P} = 4\pi\rho\vec{A} - \rho V_{0}\vec{u}.
\end{equation}

The momentum transmitted to the fluid by the body in unit time is
$\D\vec{P}/\D t$. With the opposite sign it gives the reaction of the
fluid (i.e., the force acting on the body):

\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = -\frac{\D\vec{P}}{\D t}
\end{equation}

The components of $\vec{F}$ parallel to the velocity of the body is
called the {{{define(Drag Force)}}} and the perpendicular component is
called the {{{define(Lift Force)}}}.

#+begin_proposition
(D'Alembert Paradox)
If it were possible to have potential flow past a body moving uniformly
in an ideal fluid, we should have $\vec{P}$ be constant, since $\vec{u}$
is constant, and so $\vec{F} = 0$. That is to say, there would be no
drag and no lift: the pressure forces exerted on the body by the fluid
would balance out.
#+end_proposition

Now, everything that has been said, we stress, has assumed an infinite
volume for the fluid. If the fluid has a free surface, then a body moving
uniformly parallel to this surface will experience a drag
({{{define(Wave Drag)}}}) due to the occurrence of a "system of waves"
propagated on the free surface, which continually remove energy to
infinity.
