Mortimer Adler's /The Four Dimensions of Philosophy/ (1993) noted
Natural Philosophy's scope was rather broader than current modern
science, to include:

- Astronomy and Cosmology
- "Study of nature on a grand scale"
- Etiology (study of intrinsic and extrinsic causes)
- Probability (study of chance and randomness)
- Study of Matter
- Mechanics
- Chemistry (study of elements)
- Nature of Space and Time
