* Overview

Multiphysics studies several computer models of physical phenomena,
coupled to each other. Apparently it is a contraction of "Multi-scale
physics". For our interests, the atmosphere coupled to ocean dynamics,
factoring in thermodynamic heat transfer.

#+begin_remark
COMSOL seems to be a proprietary company with some kind of software,
claiming to be the "alpha and omega" on multiphysics. I never heard of
the term before stumbling across them by accident.
