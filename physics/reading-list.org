* Currently Reading

- Landau and Lifshitz /Fluid Mechanics/.

It's not for the feint of heart, but I really enjoy it.

* Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics

- [ ] Landau and Lifshitz /Statistical Physics/
- [ ] Walter Greiner, Ludwig Neise, Horst Stocker,
  {{{book-title(Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics)}}}.
  Springer, 1995.

* Fluid Mechanics

- [ ] Landau and Lifshitz /Fluid Mechanics/
- [X] J.E. Marsden and Alexandre Chorin,
  /A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics/.
  Third ed., Springer, 1993.
- [ ] V. Arnol'd /Topological Methods in Hydrodynamics/

** Computational Fluid Dynamics

- [ ] Jiyuan Tu, Guan-Heng Yeoh, Chaqun Liu,
  /Computational Fluid Dynamics/.
  CUP, third edition.
  A really great introduction to CFD as a 6-step process.
  - Zan Xu, LÃ©opold Cambier, Juan J. Alonso, Eric Darve,
    "Towards a Scalable Hierarchical High-order CFD Solver".
    [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01763][arXiv:2101.01763]], 14 pages.
- [ ] Roger Temam,
  /Navier-Stokes Equations: Theory and Numerical Analysis/.
  AMS Chelsea Publishing, 1977.
  Focuses on steady-state solutions.

** Navier-Stokes Equations

- [ ] G.P. Galdi,
  /An Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of the Navier-Stokes Equations: Steady-State Problems/.
  Springer, second ed., 2011.
  This is probably the most authoritative reference for the special case
  of steady-flow solutions.
- [ ] Roger Taman,
  {{{book-title(Navier-Stokes equations: theory and numerical analysis)}}}.
  North-Holland press, 1979.

* Climate Related Books

- [ ] John Marshall and R. Alan Plumb,
  /Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics: an Introductory Text/.
- [ ] Kendal McGuffie, Ann Henderson-Sellers,
  /A Climate Modelling Primer/
- [ ] J. David Neelin,
  /Climate Change and Climate Modeling/.
  CUP, 2011.
  Discusses El Nino.
- [ ] Luc Tartar,
  /An Introduction to Navier Stokes Equation and Oceanography/.
  Springer 2006
- [ ] Geoffrey K. Vallis,
  /Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics_ Fundamentals and Large-Scale Circulation/.
  Cambridge University Press, 2017.
  (The first two parts [13 chapters] are about fluid dynamics, the
  remaining two parts [9 chapters] are about the climate.)
  - If I were to write a book on climate science, it would probably
    resemble this gem.
- [ ] Thomas Tomkins Warner,
  /Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction/.
  CUP, 2010.
