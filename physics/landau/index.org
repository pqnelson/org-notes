*A note on L&L's style.* It seems that Landau and Lifshitz write in a
manner that's the mirror opposite of abstract mathematics. Instead of
"theorem" and then "proof", they provide a "proof" followed by a
"theorem" (but do not announce it with a bold *Theorem* prefix).
Consequently, reading L&L amounts to trying to figure out what claims
are made in a section, then reconstructing the proof.
