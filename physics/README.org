* Overview

I will be working my way through a number of physics textbooks for
enjoyment. Being a structuralist at heart (insofar as I understand
the term), I will probably adhere to templates like we find in
Freedman and Young's /University Physics/...at least, for beginning
physics.

One of the books I hope to work my way through (even if partially)
is Kip Thorne and Roger Blanford's {{{book-title(Modern Classical
Physics: Optics, Fluids, Plasmas, Elasticity, Relativity, and
Statistical Physics)}}}.
