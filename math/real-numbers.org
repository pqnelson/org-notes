* Scientific Notation

We can represent any real number using three components:

1. Its sign (+1 or -1)
2. Its magnitude (an integer)
3. Its mantissa (a real number less than the base)

In base 10, we would write $x = s\times m\times 10^{p}$ where
$s\in\{+1,-1\}$, $0\lt m\lt 10$, and $p\in\mathbb{Z}$. Every real
number may be written in this manner, and it is called "scientific
notation".

** Binary

When we work in base 2, the mantissa is a sequence of bits with
leading bit being 1 (otherwise we could shift the mantissa down
until it is 1, and the exponent decreases by the number of
shifts). This has the advantage that $1\lt m\lt 2$, which can speed
up Taylor series computations.

For example, the logarithm of $x$ in this notation is given by

\begin{equation}
\log(x) = \log(s) + \log(m) + p\log(2)
\end{equation}

which consists of looking up stored values for $\log(2)$, and
computing a series approximation for $\log(m)$.

We can extract the components for a float in Common Lisp by

#+begin_example
USER => (multiple-value-bind (mantissa expon sign)
(decode-float f)
  (scale-float mantissa expon))
;; equivalent to (abs f)

USER> (multiple-value-bind (mantissa expon sign)
          (decode-float pi)
        (list :sign sign :mantissa mantissa :exponent expon))
;; (:SIGN 1.0d0 :MANTISSA 0.7853981633974483d0 :EXPONENT 2)
#+end_example
