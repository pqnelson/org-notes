* Overview

I'm trying to review the mathematics necessary to understand the
models of climate change, and various other physics. Although my
focus is "applied", my fascination lies more towards the "pure".

#+begin_quote
Pure mathematics is the art of the provable, but applied mathematics is
the description of what happens. These heuristics illustrate the gulf
between these realms. The domain of a theorem is bounded by extremes,
even if unlikely. Heuristics are descriptions of what is probable, not
the full range of what is possible.
