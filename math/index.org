I'm trying to review the mathematics necessary to understand the
models of climate change, and various other physics. Although my
focus is "applied", my fascination lies more towards the "pure".

#+begin_quote
Pure mathematics is the art of the provable, but applied mathematics is
the description of what happens. These heuristics illustrate the gulf
between these realms. The domain of a theorem is bounded by extremes,
even if unlikely. Heuristics are descriptions of what is probable, not
the full range of what is possible.

- Analysis (which I broadly define as subjects related to doing calculus
  in more general settings)
  - [[file:real-numbers.org][Real Numbers]]
  - [[file:infinity.org][Infinity]] and concerns with numerical analysis
  - [[file:calculus/index.org][Calculus]] (differential and integral)
  - [[file:complex-analysis.org][Complex Analysis]]
  - [[file:asymptotic/index.org][Asymptotic Analysis]] for describing the behavior of functions and
    solutions to differential equations
  - [[file:pde/index.org][Partial Differential Equations]]
- Algebra (which I broadly define as the study of...algebraic
  stuff...yes, "Algebra is what algebraists do", that's it.)
  - [[file:rings/index.org][Rings and things]]
  - [[file:differential-fields.org][Differential Fields]] after a review of polynomials
  - Heegner Numbers, like =(exp (* pi (sqrt 163)))=, which are near-integers
