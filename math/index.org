* Overview

I'm trying to review the mathematics necessary to understand the
models of climate change, and various other physics. Although my
focus is "applied", my fascination lies more towards the "pure".

- [[file:real-numbers.org][Real Numbers]]
- [[file:infinity.org][Infinity]] and concerns with numerical analysis
- [[file:proof-steps.org][Proof Steps]] in structured proofs ("formal proof sketches")
- [[file:pde.org][Partial Differential Equations]]
- Heegner Numbers, like =(exp (* pi (sqrt 163)))=, which are near-integers
