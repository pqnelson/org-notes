* Definition

#+begin_definition
The category *CRing* consisting of:
- Objects :: Commutative, associative rings with identity
- Morphisms :: Ring morphisms
#+end_definition

We can also consider the category of [[file:monoid-object.org][Monoid Objects]] in [[file:ab.org][*Ab*]] the category
of Abelian groups.

* Properties

** Cocartesian Co-Monoidal Structure

#+begin_theorem
The coproduct in *CRing* is given by the underlying tensor product of
Abelian groups equipped with the induced commutative ring structure.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_corollary
The tensor product of commutative rings exhibits he cartesian monoidal
category structure on the opposite category $\cat{CRing}^{op}$.
#+end_corollary
