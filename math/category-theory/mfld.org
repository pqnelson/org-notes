The category *Mfld* has

- Objects :: Smooth Manifolds
- Morphisms :: Smooth (i.e., $C^{\infty}$) mappings

#+begin_remark
The notation for the name of this category varies wildly: *Diff*, *Man*,
among others. But since *Diff* is also used for diffeological spaces,
and *Man* seems like it's useful for other things, I opted for *Mfld*.
