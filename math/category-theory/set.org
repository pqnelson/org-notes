*Set* is the (or a) category with sets as objects and functions between
sets as morphisms. This is vague, because we could "parametrize" the
category with different choices of axioms that sets should specify,
like:
- First-order vs higher-order logic
- Impredicative vs predicative mathematics
- Classical logic vs intuitionistic logic
- Axiom of choice
- Replacement or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement#Collection][collection]] principles
- Smallness structures

...and much, much more! We could fine-tune the axioms of set theory, by
adding things like cardinal hypotheses.
