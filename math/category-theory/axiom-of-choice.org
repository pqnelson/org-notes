* For Category of Sets

The axiom of choice may be phrased as:

#+ATTR_HTML: :id prop-choice-in-set
#+begin_proposition
Every surjection in the category [[file:set.org][Set]] of sets splits.
#+end_proposition

* In other categories
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-a3bc924d-3c32-49ec-b5e8-cb59597ef203
:END:

There are different ways to formulate the axiom of choice in other
categories.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id defn-external-choice
#+begin_definition
We say the category $C$ satisfies the {{{define(External Axiom of Choice)}}}
if every epimorphism in $C$ splits.
#+end_definition

When the category we're working in has an internal logic (or it's a
topos), we may "internalize" the axiom of choice asserting "every
epimorphism has a section" is true in the internal logic. Another way to
phrase this is exponentiation by an object preserves epimorphisms (every
object is an "internally projective object").
