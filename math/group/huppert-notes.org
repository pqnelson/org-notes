This is just the "theorem statements" and definitions. No proof given,
since they can be found elsewhere.

It seems the German word /Hilfssatz/ translates to "Lemma".

/Folgerung/ seems to be "Corollary"?

/Bemerkung/ is "remark".

/Satz/ is "proposition" (well, literally "sentence", but it corresponds
to a "lesser theorem").

:END:

The nonempty set $G$ is called a {{{dfn(Group)}}} if it satisfies the
following:

1. For each pair $(A,B)$ of elements $A,B\in G$, there exists a unique element
   $C$ of $G$, which we write as $C=AB$. We call $C$ the /product/ of
   $A$ and $B$.
2. For every $A,B,C\in G$, we have the product be associative: $(AB)C=A(BC)$.
3. There is an element $E\in G$ such that $EA=A$ for every $A\in G$.
4. For every $A\in G$ there is a $B\in G$ such that $BA=E$.

*** Corollary: products of all tuples of a set of group elements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-88f7bca2-2c9f-4881-babf-e777467194f4
:END:

For any non-empty subsets of a group $G$, we can multiply them together.
We recursively define the product $P_{k}(-)$ --- if $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, \dots are elements of
$G$, and the subscript on $P$ indicates how many elements we're
multiplying together --- by:

1. $P_{1}(A_{1})= \{A_{1}\}$
2. $P_{2}(A_{1},A_{2})=\{A_{1}A_{2}\}$
3. $P_{n}(A_{1},\dots,A_{h})=\{XY\mid X\in P_{k}(A_{1},\dots,A_{k}),
   Y\in P_{m}(A_{k+1},\dots,A_{k+m}), k+m=n\}$

We usually write $A_{1}\cdots A_{k}$ for $P_{k}(A_{1},\dots,A_{k})$.

*** Corollary: existence of right inverse, identity element, inverse law
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-a0fa1517-c651-4693-87c8-9ebbfd45e83a
:END:

1. $E$ is the identity element of the group $G$, so $AE=A$ for each
   $A\in G$
2. If $BA=E$, then $AB=E$
3. If $AX=AY$ or $XA=YA$, then $X=Y$.

*** Corollary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-73ac7d0a-0de2-4abe-be8b-b5a46249be19
:END:

If $G$ is a group, suppose $A,B\in G$, then there exists an element
$X\in G$ such that $AX=B$. There also exists an element $Y\in G$ such
that $YA=B$.

*** Corollary: inverse is idempotent, inverse of products
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-5e43fa8c-806b-421e-ade0-e28d99fc96db
:END:

1. For any $A\in G$ there is a unique element $X\in G$ such that $AX=XA=E$.
   We call $X$ the inverse element of $A$ and denote $X=A^{-1}$.
2. We have for any $A,B\in G$ the inverse of their product
   $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$ and $(A^{-1})^{-1}=A$.

*** Definition: power of group element
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-4db6575e-f769-4d8d-8040-540f4ea69256
:END:

We can define the $n^{\text{th}}$ power of a group element $A\in G$ by
$A^{0}=E$, $A^{n+1}=A^{n}A$ if $n\gt 0$, and $A^{-n}=(A^{n})^{-1}$. We
also have $A^{m+n}=A^{m}A^{n}$ for any $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$.

*** Definition: Order of Group
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-ef973ab0-8bfb-4675-bcb4-bee978838160
:END:

We denote, for any set $M$, its cardinality by $|M|$. Then we define the
{{{dfn(Order)}}} of a group $G$ to be the cardinality of its underlying
set, and denote it by $|G|$.

*** Definition: Group isomorphism
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-1bce340b-9b94-49e0-b65f-2b7f78025390
:END:

Two groups, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, are called isomorphic if there are
there is a one-to-one mapping $\pi$ from $G_{1}$ to $G_{2}$

$\pi(gh) = \pi(g)\pi(h)$

for all elements $g$ and $h$ from $G_{1}$. We then write $G_{1}\cong G_{2}$. Group
isomorphism is obviously an equivalence relation.

By {{{dfn(Group Property)}}} we understand a property
which if $G$ has it, then every group isomorphic to $G$ also has the property.

*** Corollary: Isomorphisms preserve identity element and inverses
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-d8f28fcc-1815-4ae7-8068-c0f8d1205f12
:END:

If $\pi\colon G_{1}\to G_{2}$ is an isomorphism and $E_{1}\in G_{1}$ and
$E_{2}\in G_{2}$ are identity element, then $\pi(E_{1})=E_{2}$.

Further, for any $g\in G_{1}$ we have $\pi(g^{-1})=[\pi(g)]^{-1}$.

*** Definition: Abelian Group
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-74b9e9f7-7512-4adf-8d1f-c8f006869080
:END:

The group $G$ is called {{{dfn(Abelian)}}} (or also /commutative/),
if $AB = BA$ for all elements $A$ and $B$ from $G$. Then each
product $A_{1}\dots A_{n}$ with $A_{i}\in G$ independent of the
arrangement of the $A_{i}.

** Subgroups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-87333076-41f1-44f8-8721-4e73e6ccdf6f
:END:

*** Definition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-64445783-8682-45c5-80ed-933c9f85081f
:END:

We call a subset $U\subset G$ a {{{dfn(Subgroup)}}} of $G$ if it is
closed under $G$'s binary operator:

For any $u_{1}$, $u_{2}\in U$ we have $u_{1}u_{2}\in U$; for any $u\in
U$, we have $u^{-1}\in U$. We also have $E\in U$, but this follows by
combining these two conditions together.

We write $U\leq G$ to indicate $U$ is a subgroup of $G$. If $U\neq G$,
then we write $U\lt G$.

Every group $G$ has a subgroup $\mathbf{1}=\{E\}$ consisting of only the
identity element. We call $\mathbf{1}$ the {{{dfn(Trivial Subgroup)}}}
of $G$.

*** Corollary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-a7987416-4736-41cd-ba0f-039115842280
:END:

If $U$ is a finite subset of the group $G$, and if for any
$u_{1}$, $u_{2}$, from $U$ we also have $u_{1}u_{2}\in U$,
then $U$ is a subgroup of $G$.

*** Proposition: intersection of subgroups form a subgroup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-c68c9124-0f89-4845-a035-7c9f5fc42c51
:END:

If $U_{i}$ is a family of subgroups of $G$ indexed by $i\in I$,
then $\bigcap_{i\in I}U_{i}$ is a subgroup of $G$.

*** Definition: subgroup generated by a subset
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-d012307d-d241-41cf-ada7-8901beedf270
:END:

Let $M$ be a subset of a group $G$. We denote by $\langle M\rangle$ the
intersection of all subgroups of $G$ which contain $M$. Obviously
$\langle M\rangle$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $M$.

If we write $M^{-1}=\{g^{-1}\mid g\in M\}$, then we can write

\begin{equation}
\langle M\rangle = \{ e,\; x_{1}\dots x_{s}\mid x_{j}\in M\cup M^{-1}, 1\leq j\leq s, s\in\mathbb{N}\}.
\end{equation}

If $M=\{A,B,\dots\}$, then we can write $\langle M\rangle=\langle A,B,\dots\rangle$.

If $G=\langle M\rangle$, then we call $M$ a set of {{{dfn(Generating Set)}}}
for $G$.

We call a group generated by a single element {{{dfn(Cyclic)}}}.
If we always write $A^{0}=E$, then $\langle A\rangle$ consists of the
elements $A^{m}$ with $m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots$ which are not necessarily
all different.

*** Proposition: Multiply a subset by group element, left cosets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-9ab0f0c3-cd41-4530-ac95-9bf3df607347
:END:

If $U\leq G$ is a subgroup, then $gU=\{gu\mid u\in U\}$ for any $g\in G$
which we call {{{dfn(Left Cosets)}}} of $U$ in $G$. For any $g,h\in G$
we have either $gU\cap hU=\emptyset$ or $gU=hU$.

The group $G$ is the disjoint union of all different left cosets $gU$.

If the set $\mathcal{R}$ contains exactly one element from each left
coset of $U$, then we call $\mathcal{R}$ a system of {{{dfn(Left Coset
Representatives)}}} of $U$ in $G$.

The decomposition
\begin{equation}
G = \bigcup_{R\in \mathcal{R}} RU
\end{equation}
we call the "decomposition of $G$ into left cosets by $U$".

All cosets of $U$ have the same cardinality $|U|$. We call the
cardinality $|\mathcal{R}|$ the {{{dfn(Index)}}} of $U$ in $G$ and write
$[G:U]$.

*** Proposition: Right cosets, factoring decomposition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-b064cd35-cc87-431b-b4e9-51d8c2a5c3e8
:END:

1. Let $U$ be a subgroup of $G$. If $G=\bigcup_{R\in\mathcal{R}}UR$ is
   the decomposition of $G$ into right cosets of $U$, then
   $G=\bigcup_{R\in\mathcal{R}}R^{-1}U$ is a decomposition into left
   cosets of $U$. (Specifically, we don't have between distinguish a
   left and right index of $U$ in $G$.)
2. If $G=\bigcup_{R\in \mathcal{R}}UR$ is a decomposition of $G$ into
   right cosets of the subgroup $U$, and $U=\bigcup_{S\in\mathcal{S}}BS$ is a
   decomposition of $U$ by $B$, then $G=\bigcup_{S\in\mathcal{S},R\in \mathcal{R}} BSR$ is the decomposition of $G$ into right-cosets of
   $B$. In particular, $[G:B] = [G:U][U:B]$.


*** Lagrange's Theorem
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-9492837d-e706-479e-a64a-505d563fa05b
:END:

Let $G$ be a finite group, let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup. Then
$|G|=|H|[G:H]$. In particular, the order and index of a subgroup of a
finite group always divide the group's order.

*** Definition: Order of element, exponent of group
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-6c7e08bd-d4f9-4021-9ae9-f2e7e6512294
:END:

Let $g$ be an element of group $G$. The smallest number $n\in\NN$ with
$g^{n}=E$ we call the {{{dfn(Order)}}} of $g$, denoted $o(g)$.
If there is no such number, then $o(g)=\infty$.

The least common multiple of the orders of all elements $g\in G$ is the
{{{dfn(Exponent)}}} of $G$, and denote this by $\exp(G)$.

*** Proposition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-8ca37550-9242-4fe8-bb8a-9ac652d7ada5
:END:

Let G be a group. Let $g\in G$ with $o(g) = n\lt\infty$. Then:

1. $n|m$ follows from $g^{m} = E$.
2. $\langle g\rangle = \{E, g, g^{2}, \dots, g^{n-1}\}$ and
   $\langle g\rangle = o(g) = n$.
   In particular, $o(g)$ divides $|G|$ for finite $G$.
3. If k is an integer rational number, then $o(g^{k}) = n/(n,k)$.

*** Proposition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-9733f1a5-14db-43e0-96bd-c0be59cf5135
:END:

Every group of prime order is cyclic.

(This is only the first in a long line of theorems where we derive
information about $G$ from prime
factorizations of $|G|$.)

*** Definition: Multiplying subsets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-37a9ae10-db64-47ff-bdaa-e1ba71512c2f
:END:

If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of the group $G$, then we set
$AB=\{ab\mid a\in A,b\in B\}$.

*** Lemma
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-0dec1ad8-7dcc-4798-bfa8-4f4141921e31
:END:

1. If $A = \bigcup_{R\in \mathcal{R}} R(A\cap B)$ is the coset decomposition from A to $A\cap B$,
   then $AB = \bigcup_{R\in \mathcal{R}} RB$ is a disjoint
   decomposition of the set $AB$. In particular, if $A$ and $B$ are finite,
   then $|AB|=|A||B|/|A\cap B|$.
2. $AB$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if $AB = BA$.
3. (Dedehind identity) $A\leq C\leq G$ and $C\subset AB$, then it
   follows that $C=AB\cap C=A(B\cap C)$.


*** Lemma
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-2c3b1285-7697-4464-8f9c-0f28c0405e56
:END:

Let $A$ and $B$ be subgroups of $G$ of finite
Index. Then:

1. $[G: A\cap B] \leq [G : A][G : B]$.
2. If $[G: A]$ and $[G: B]$ are divisors, then $[G:A\cap B]=[G:A][G:B]$.
   If $G$ is finite, then $G = AB$.


*** Lemma: Conjugation by Element
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-eb8ccf50-688d-44f2-b5b2-6bb89e393664
:END:

If $a$ and $g$ are elements of $G$, then we let $g^{a}=a^{-1}ga$.
We call the mapping $g\to g^{a}$ the transformation with $a$. then
the following rules apply:

- (1) $g^{ab}=(g^{a})^{b}$.
- (2) $(gh)^{a}=g^{a}h^{a}$
- (3) $(g^{a})^{-1} = (g^{-1})^{a}$

We also define $g^{a+b}$ by $g^{a+b}=g^{a}g^{b}$. However, it should be noted
that then i. a. $g^{a+b}\neq g^{b+a}$ because the elements $g^{a}$ and $g^{b}$ are not
necessary interchangeable. But the following always applies:

- (4) $g^{ab+ac} = (g^{a})^{b+c}$ and
- (5) $g^{ba + ca} = (g^{b+c})^{a}$.

*** Definition: Conjugating a subset, subgroup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-c6a9a205-731a-4c41-97ae-e615125125bc
:END:

If $M$ is a nonempty subset of $G$ and $g\in G$,
so we set $M^{g} = \{m^{g}\mid m\in M\}$.
We call the sets $M^{g}$ the conjugates of $M$ in $G$.

If $U$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $U^{g}$ is a subgroup of $G$ isomorphic to $U$:
The group property of $U^{g}$ follows from 2.14 (2) and (3).
The mapping $\pi$ from $U$ to $U^{g}$ with $\pi(u)= u^{g}$, which is divided by $\alpha$ with
$\alpha(u^{g}) = (u^{g})^{g^{-1}}$ is reversed, by 2.14 (2) there is an
isomorphism from $U$ to $U^{g}$.

*** Proposition: Conjugacy classes, the Class Equation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-774e5b95-b7df-4985-86bf-d2729ccb8f44
:END:

Let $M=\{m\}$ be a set of one element. Then we call the set $\{m^{g}\mid g\in G\}$
of elements conjugate to $m$ in $G$ the {{{dfn(Conjugacy Class)}}} $m$ in $G$.
The conjugacy classes are equivalence classes for the following
equivalence relation:

Let $x\sim y$ if there is a $g\in G$ such that $x^{g} = y$. If $G$ is
finite, then the partition into conjugacy classes yields a disjoint decomposition
$G = \bigcup^{h}_{i}R_{i}$
and the equation
\begin{equation}
|G| = \sum^{h}_{i=1}|R_{i}|\quad\mbox{(so-called class equation)}
\end{equation}
where the $R_{i}$ are the different conjugacy classes of $G$.
We call the number $h$ of conjugacy classes the {{{dfn(Class Number of
$G$)}}}.

*** Definition: Normalizer, Centralizer, Center
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-1dba1a8e-07d9-42c8-8364-2c5a138af76e
:END:

1. Let $M$ be a subset of $G$. Then we call $N_{G}(M) = \{g|g\in G, M^{g}=M\}$
   the {{{dfn(Normalizer)}}} of $M$ in $G$. Obviously $N_{G}(M)$ is a subgroup
   by $G$. If $U$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $U\leq N_{G}(U)$ holds. Apparently is
   $N_{G}(M^{X} = N_{G}(M)^{X}$ for all $X\in G$.
2. The set $C_{G}(M) = \{g\mid g\in G, gm=mg\mbox{ for all }m\in M\}$
   is called the {{{dfn(Centralizer)}}} of $M$ in $G$. $C_{G}(M)$ is also a subgroup
   of $G$, and obviously $C_{G}(M)\leq N_{G}(M)$ holds. If $U$ is an
   Abelian subgroup of $G$, then we have $U\leq C_{G}(U)$.
3. We set $C_{G}(G) = Z(G)$ and call this the {{{dfn(Center)}}} of G.
   So the center $Z(G)$ of $G$ consists of those elements
   of $G$, which commute with every element of $G$.

*** Proposition: Number of Conjugacy Classes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-9e20e311-07f3-4751-870a-7563e813cec3
:END:

The index $[G:N_{G}(M)]$ is the number of distinct conjugacy classes of
$M$ in $G$.

*** Proposition: Double Cosets Partition $G$
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-97e72420-0692-43b8-8568-7521bc51569d
:END:

Let $U$ and $B$ be subgroups of $G$. We call
$U g B = \{ugv\mid u\in U, v\in B\}$ (with $g\in G$)
{{{dfn(Double Cosets)}}} of $U$,
$B$ in $G$.

From $U g B\cap U h B\neq\emptyset$ it follows $UgB = UhB$.
So the double cosets yield a disjoint decomposition of $G$.
If $G$ is finite, then

$$G=\bigcup^{n}_{i}Ug_{i}B\quad\mbox{(disjoint)}$$

and

$$|G| = \sum^{n}_{i=1}\frac{|U||B|}{|U^{g_{i}}\cap B|}.$$

*** Proposition: Subgroups of Cyclic Group
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-8265e1a5-18e1-4704-b7f4-966a1c19fd79
:END:

Let $G = \langle g\rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $o(g)$. Then
there is exactly one subgroup of order $d$ for each factor $d$ of $o(g)$
of $G$, namely $\langle g^{k}\rangle$ with $k = o(g)/d$.

:END:

The subgroup $N$ of $G$ is called a {{{dfn(Normal Subgroup)}}} of $G$ (often also
called normal subgroup or invariant subgroup) if
$N^{g}\leq N$ holds for all $g$ from $G$. We then write $N\trianglelefteq G$
or $N\triangleleft G$, if $N$ differs from $G$. Every group $G$ owns the
trivial normal subgroup $G$ and $\mathbf{1}$.

If $G$ has only the normal subgroups $\mathbf{1}$ and $G$, then we call
$G$ a {{{dfn(Simple)}}} group. Obviously every group of prime order is
simple.

*** Proposition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-5a442315-05ac-415d-89bd-9b2fda7d0df8

Let $N$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then the following are equivalent:
1. $N\trianglelefteq G$.
2. $N^{g} = N$ for all $g\in G$.
3. $gN=Ng$ for all $g\in G$.
4. Every left coset of $N$ is a right coset of $N$.

*** Remark

If $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ with $[G : N] = 2$, then
$N\triangleleft G$.

We have $(gN)(hN)=gh N$ on the set of left cosets of subgroup $N$ of $G$
be well-defined multiplication operator precisely when $N$ is normal in $G$.

When equipped with this multiplication, the cosets of $N$ form a group.

If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then the cosets of  $N$
equipped with the multiplication $(gN)(hN)=ghN$
form a group called the {{{dfn(factor group)}}} of $G$ by $N$.
We denote it by $G/N$. Obviously $|G/N| = [G : N]$ holds.

1. The mapping $\pi$ from the group $G$ to the group $H$ is called a
   {{{dfn(Homomorphism)}}} from $G$ to $H$ if for any $g_{1},g_{2}\in G$
   we have $\pi(g_{1}g_{2}) = \pi(g_{1})\pi(g_{2})$.
   We write $\pi(G) = G^{\pi}=\{\pi(g)\mid g\in G\}$
   and call $\pi(G) = G^{\pi}$ the {{{dfn(Image of $G$ under $\pi$)}}}.
2. The homomorphism $\pi$ from $G$ to $H$ is called an {{{dfn(Epimorphism)}}}
   if $\pi$ is a surjective mapping from $G$ to $H$, i.e. if $H = G^{\pi}$ holds.
3. The homomorphism $\pi$ of $G$ in $H$ is called a {{{dfn(Monomorphism)}}},
   if $\pi$ is an injective mapping from $G$ to $\pi(G)$.
4. A homomorphism from $G$ to $G$ is called an {{{dfn(Endomorphism)}}} of $G$.

Let $\pi$ be a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$.

1. If $E$ is the identity element of $G$, then $\pi(E)$ is the identity element of $H$.
2. For each $g\in G$ we have $\pi(g^{-1})= \pi(g)^{-1}$.
3. $\pi(G) = \{\pi(g)\mid g\in G\}$ is a subgroup of $H$.
4. If $M$ is a generator system of $G$, then the homomorphism is

2. Let $\pi$ be a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. Let $K=\{g|g\in G,\pi(g)=e\}$.
   We call $K$ the {{{dfn(kernel of $\pi$)}}}.
   Then $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and it gives a monomorphism
   $\varphi$ from $G/K$ to $H$ with $\alpha\varphi=\pi$.
   In particular, $G/K = \pi(G)$.

If the $N_{i}$ with $i\in I$ are normal subgroups of $G$, then both their
product $\langle N_{i}\mid i\in I\rangle$ and their intersection
$\bigcap_{i \in I}N_{i}$ are normal subgroups of $G$.

Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.

1. Among the subgroups $U$ of $G$ with $N\leq U\leq G$ and all the
   subgroups of $\bar{G} = G/N$ there is a one-to-one correspondence $\alpha$
   that preserves the lattice operations intersection and product
   defined by $\alpha(U)= U/N$.
2. For $N\leq U\leq G$ we have $[G : U] = [G/N: U/N]$.
3. If $N\leq M\trianglelefteq G$, then $M/N\trianglelefteq G/N$ and
   $(G/N)/(M/N) = G/M$.

If $M$ and $N$ are normal subgroups of $G$ with $M\cap N=\mathbf{1}$,
then $mn=nm$ holds for all $m$ from $M$ and all $n$ from $N$.
We then say: $M$ and $N$ are elementwise commutable.

An isomorphism from $G$ to itself is called an {{{dfn(Automorphism)}}}
of $G$. The automorphisms of $G$ form a group $A(G)$ with respect to the
following product definition:

For $\alpha,\beta\in A(G)$ let $\alpha\beta$ be defined by
$(\beta\alpha)(g)=\beta(\alpha(g))$.

The group $A(G)$ is called the {{{dfn(Automorphism Group)}}} of $G$. If $G$ is
finite, then obviously $A(G)$ is also finite

*** Proposition: Inner Automorphisms

Every mapping $\alpha$ of the form
$\alpha(x) = x^{g}$ with $g\in G$
is an automorphism of $G$, a so-called {{{dfn(Inner Automorphism)}}}.

Inner automorphisms form a normal subgroup $I(G)$ of $A(G)$.
We call the group $I(G)$ the inner automorphism group of $G$.
It is isomorphic to the factor group $G/Z(G)$ of $G$ modulo its center $Z(G)$.

*** Proposition

:END:

Let $M$ and $N$ be normal subgroups of $G$ with $M\leq N$.
Let $U$ be a subgroup of the automorphism group $A(G)$ of $G$.
For every automorphism $\alpha$ from $U$, suppose $\alpha(M)=M$ and $\alpha(N)=N$ hold.
Then the mapping $\bar{\alpha}$ with

$\bar\alpha(nM) = \alpha(n)M$ for $n\in N$

is an automorphism of $N/M$, the assignment of $\alpha$ to $\bar\alpha$
gives a homomorphism of $U$ in the automorphism group $A(N/M)$ of $N/M$.
The kernel of this homomorphism consists of the automorphisms
$\alpha$ from $U$ of the form $\alpha(n) = nm(n)$ with $m(n)\in M$ for
all $n$ from $N$. The $m(n)$ suffice for the functional equation $m(n_{1}n_{2}) = m(n_{1})^{n_{2}}m(n_{2})$.
(In §17 we shall have to speak in detail about this functional
equation.)

In the special case $U = I(G)$ we give for the kernel of the composite
Homomorphism from $G$ (via $I(G)$) to $A(N/M)$ the notation

$C_{G}(N/M) = \{G \mid n^{g}M = nM \mbox{ for every }n\in N\}$.

Then clearly then $G/C_{G}(N/M)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $A(N/M)$.
(For $M = \mathbf{1}$, $C_{G} (N/\mathbf{1})$ is the centralizer
$C_{G}(M)$ introduced in 2.17b.)

Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ and $\alpha$ an automorphism of $G$
with $\alpha(n)=n$ for all $n\in N$ and $gN = \alpha(g)N$ for all $g\in G$.
Then $\alpha(g) = gT(g)$, where $T(g)$ lies in $Z(N)$, depends only on
the coset $gN$ and the functional equation $T(gh) = T(g)^{h}T(h)$ from
Theorem 4.3 is satisfied.

All automorphisms $\alpha$ of the given form are pairwise commutable.
If $m$ is the exponent of $Z(N)$, then $\alpha^{m}=1$.
In particular, if $(O(\alpha), |Z(N|) = 1$, then $\alpha = 1$.

Then the automorphisms of $G$ have the form $\alpha(g) = g^{k}$ with $(k, n) = 1$.
The automorphism group $A(G)$ of $G$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative
group of remainders mod $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. In
particular, $|A(G)| = \varphi(n)$, where $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function
from number theory.

of $G$ if $\alpha(U) = U$ for every automorphism $\alpha$ of $G$.
(Obviously every characteristic subgroup of $G$ is a normal subgroup of
$G$.) If $G$ has only the characteristic subgroups $\mathbf{1}$ and $G$,
then $G$ is called characteristically simple.

   Let $G$ be the group of integral linear maps $x\to ax + b$ over the ring of integers modulo 8 with $a = 1 (2)$.
   (The order of $G$ is 25.)
   Then the map is $\alpha$, which transforms $G$ with $xG =ax+b$ into $\alpha(G)$ with $x\alpha(G) = ax + b + \frac{1}{2 }(a^{2}-1)$ is an automorphism of $G$ which maps every element of $G$ to a conjugate, but which is not an inner automorphism of $G$.

Let $\Omega$ be a finite set with $|\Omega| = n$.
We denote the elements of $\Omega$ using the natural numbers 1, \dots, $n$ (to
distinguish them from group elements).

The set of all one-to-one mappings from $\Omega$ to itself becomes a
group if we define the product $gh$ of two mappings $g$ and $h$ by
$i^{gh}=(i^{g})^{h}$ $(i\in \Omega)$.

We call this group the {{{dfn(Symmetric Group)}}} $S_{n}$ of degree $n$ (on $\Omega$).
Obviously $|S_{n}|=n!$ holds.
We call the elements of $S_{n}$ permutations and often write them in the
form $G = \binom{i}{i^{g}}$.
If $\Delta$ is a subset of $\Omega$ and $g\in S_{n}$, we write
$\Delta^{g} = \{i^{g}\mid i\in \Delta\}$.

A permutation of shape

$$ P = \begin{pmatrix}a_{1} & a_{2} & \dots & a_{k-1} & a_{k} & a_{k+1} & \dots & a_{n}\\
a_{2} & a_{3} & \dots & a_{k} & a_{1} & a_{k+1} & \dots & a_{n}\end{pmatrix}$$

(or in short: $P = (a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{k})$) means a $k$ cycle
or cycle of length $k$.

We call the 2-cycles {{{dfn(transpositions)}}}.

Every permutation $g$ can be written uniquely (up to ordering) as the
product of disjoint cycles, which do not have a common digit.

The fixed digits $i$ at $g$ appear with $i^{g} = i$ as cycles of the
length 1 and are usually not written down.
If the lengths of these cycles $z_{1},\dots,z_{m}$, then the order $o(g)$
of $g$ is the least common multiple of $z_{i}$.
We call the $m$ tuple $(z_{1}, \dots, z_{m})$ the {{{dfn(Permutation type)}}} of $g$.

$T = \binom{a_{i}}{b_{i}}\dots\binom{s_{j}}{t_{j}}$.
Then $g^{T} = T^{-1}gT$ has the cycle decomposition
$g^{T} = (b_{1}, \dots, b_{k})\dots(t_{1},\dots,t_{m})$.

In particular, it follows that the conjugation classes $S_{n}$ consist
of permutations of the same type.
