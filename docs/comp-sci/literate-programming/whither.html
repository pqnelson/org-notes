It’s been more than three decades since literate programming was
invented by the legendary Donald Knuth. Its promise was immense —
creating software which was more reliable, more understandable, more
maintainable, and with hugely more teaching value — software which
targeted <i>both</i> humans <i>and</i> computers.
</p>

<p>
What is literate programming? How has literate programming evolved? Why
hasn’t literate programming taken off? Where is it headed?
</p>

<p>
In this three-part series, we’ll take a detailed look at these
questions. This first part is an introduction to what is literate
programming. (The second part, an overview of the challenges with
literate programming, is here.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-c1eb4c1f-b1b9-4836-adce-948b43c8cacc">
<p>
Let’s define literate programming.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Literate programming refers to melding a descriptive narrative and
computer code into a single document, from which both human-friendly
documentation and computer-readable files can be created.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let us quote from Knuth’s <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">paper on literate programming</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist,
whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an
author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully
and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program
that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an
order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal
and informal methods that reınforce each other.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Knuth says, the document does not have to, and in fact probably
should not, follow the lexical order of the source code, whatever that
is; instead, the whole idea is that its order should be most meaningful
to human readers (he calls this the “stream of consciousness”
order). The process of creating the document is called <b>weaving</b>; the
process of creating the compilable files is called <b>tangling</b>.
</p>


<p>
In a 2008 interview, Knuth also claims increased productivity as well as
more happiness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Not only has it enabled me to write and maintain programs <b>faster</b> and
more reliably than ever before, and been one of my greatest sources of
<b>joy</b> since the 1980s — it has actually been indispensable at times.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-999d5b14-5507-48f7-917a-2ce253121413">
<p>
In addition to various works published by Knuth in what he called WEB,
his initial implementation of literate programming, there are several
outstanding examples of literate programming. Perhaps the most ambitious
is the CGI book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Physically-Based-Rendering-Theory-Implementation/dp/0128006455">“Physically Based Rendering”</a> by Pharr and
Humphreys, which is famous for being the only book ever to have won an
Academy Award (Knuth said it should have also won a Pulitzer):
</p>

<p>
Other books cited as great examples of literate programming style
include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Interfaces-Implementations-Techniques-Creating-Reusable/dp/0201498413/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535698536">“C Interfaces and Implementations”</a> by David R. Hanson:
</p>

<p>
The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lisp-Small-Pieces-Christian-Queinnec/dp/0521545668">“Lisp in Small Pieces”</a> is sometimes cited as an example of
literate programming, but it seems to really be narrative interspersed
with code fragments for didactic purposes.
</p>

<p>
One <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10070549">post in a Hacker News thread</a> from three years ago described the
thorough-going use of literate programming at a major defense
contractor, with excellent results. He notes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It forced us to keep things clean, modular and simple. It meant doing
everything took longer the first time, but at the point of actually
writing the code, the coder had a really good picture of exactly what it
had to do and exactly where it fitted in to the grander scheme. There
was little revisiting or rewriting, and usually the first version
written was the last version written. It also made debugging a lot
easier.
</p>

In this section, we review various alternatives and point out why they
are <i>not</i> literate programming in the strict sense of the word.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h-9c07e10d-f7b5-4373-bfd3-75086c32c23d">
<p>
Systems such as <a href="http://ashkenas.com/docco/">docco</a> already do something superficially similar to
literate programming. docco is a way to present nicely formatted output
of comments, alongside or interspersed with source code. It not only
treats the comments as Markdown, meaning you can apply styles, but also
applies automatic syntax highlighting to your code. Underscore’s
<a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html">annotated source code</a> is a classic, well-executed example of using
docco, which supports virtually any language. There are dozens of
variations of this product. It’s a great piece of work, but it’s not
literate programming, most basically because it’s missing the key
feature of re-ordering and transclusion.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h-903c6781-ed3f-4b77-80b5-2fabf264eb23">
<p>
What about systems like Jupyter, which provides a great notebook format
mixing narrative and code, with the added bonus that code can be
executed right in the “notebook”, with the output, including
visualizations, visible in real time? Although its roots are in the
Python world, Jupyter now supports other data-focused languages such as
R and Julia. But as wonderfully useful as Jupyter and similar systems,
such as <a href="http://beta.observablehq.com/">ObservableHQ</a> (coming from the d3 world) are, and they are
becoming wildly popular as a way for data scientists to do and present
their work, we should distinguish them from literate programming. They
may contain little programs, but they are not intended to be a
programming system. The Wolfram Language (the language of Mathematica)
also appears to fall into this “live notebook” category.

CoffeeScript offers a <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#literate">literate programming mode</a>, in which narrative
material is mixed with code (identified by being indented) in files with
the <code>.literatecoffee</code> extension. However, purists would say this is
nothing more than a syntactic alternative for comments, and that it
fails to meet the basic literate programming criteria of allowing the
author to re-order the program to present it in more human-friendly
fashion.
</p>

<p>
Haskell offers a well-regarded <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming">literate programming mode</a>. A tool called
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haddock">Haddock</a> generates documentation from annotated source code. It offers
two solutions to the classic problem of how to distinguish narrative
from code when doing literate programming: “Bird notation”, where each
line of code is prefixed with a “&gt;”, and LaTeX notation, where code is
surrounded by <code>`</code> , <code>\begin{code}</code> and <code>\end{code}</code> pairs (latex style); other
formatting unfortunately requires knowledge of LaTeX as well.
</p>

<p>
However, purists would again object to calling this feature, as useful
as it is, “literate programming”. They would point to the lack of any
ability to include fragments of code in other fragments, or the
full-fledged ability to present the code in a different order than it is
to be presented to the compiler.
</p>

<p>
For R aficionados, there is the <code>sweave</code> package — also LaTeX dependent —
and its successors, including <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr">knitr</a>. And there are many others.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the only current tools that really qualify as literate
program in the strict Knuthian sense of the word are all quite long in
the tooth — for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb">noweb</a>, a simplified 1990s port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a> (a C
language version of Knuth’s original WEB system).

literate programming has gotten so little traction over the decades. In

<p>
What is literate programming? How has literate programming evolved? Why
hasn’t literate programming taken off? Where is it headed?
</p>

<p>
In the first article in this three part series, we addressed the first
of these questions, learning about what literate programming is,
something of its history, and the great promise it holds. Let us recall
the definition of literate programming:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Literate programming harmonizes the human and machine aspects of
programming into an integral whole which best expresses and communicates
a software solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But something went horribly wrong. The Google Trends chart below shows
starkly the inexorable decline in interest in literate programming.
</p>

<p>
[graph omitted]
</p>

<p>
From a high point in 2004 — and remember that at this point a lot of the
air had already gone out of the literate programming balloon — interest
has declined to almost zero, relatively speaking.
</p>

<p>
What went wrong? That is the topic of this second article in our series
of literate programming.Let’s try to identify some of the causes of the
virtual complete lack of momentum in recent years. Some of these reasons
may be intrinsic to the activity of programming and programming behavior
in any era; others may have appeared, or been aggravated, by recent
changes in the environment.
</p>

<p>
Once we understand better what happened with literate programming, and
the factors affecting its adoption (or lack thereof), we will be ready
to propose a new generation of literate programming concepts and tools —
and a new series of use cases — which will finally allow us to realize
the potential of Knuth’s conceptual breakthrough. That will be the topic
of the third and final article in this series.
</p>

<p>
Now, with no further ado, let us proceed to examine the factors that
have slowed, and could continue to slow, the spread of literate
programming.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-0b6713f2-af64-4189-8507-5b5de0c041d6">
<p>
To understand the genesis of literate programming, and the reasons it
failed to catch on, let’s briefly review some historical background.
</p>

<p>
First, in 1984 there was no world-wide web or even really PCs for that
matter; “documentation” was printed on paper. Knuth, of course, was a
pioneer in computer-based typesetting with his TeX system, and so it is
not surprising that his initial implementation of literate programming
was designed to produce TeX documents. That meant, unfortunately, that
users had to know TeX to some extent, and that the source documents were
littered with incomprehensible TeX commands, so people had to write
things like this:
</p>

<p>
[picture omitted, presumably some straightforward TeX markup.]
</p>

<p>
Ouch.
</p>

<p>
Second, it turns out that at the time Knuth was programming in Pascal,
an early modern language that could be said to be based on ALGOL (the
progenitor of high-level structured programming languages), and was
later made famous by the ubiquitous Turbo Pascal. However, Pascal
imposed a number of limitations. For instance, it had no preprocessor or
<code>#define</code> like capability such as found in C; and it had restrictions on
things like the order of declarations. Knuth’s literate programming
initiative, which he called <code>WEB</code>, can be viewed in part as being a kind
of Pascal preprocessor to make up for these limitations.
</p>

<p>
Some critics of literate program say that modern programming
environments no longer have these kinds of issues, which has made
something like Knuth’s <code>WEB</code> less necessary. That’s just one of the many
criticisms of literate programming, which we go over in a following
section.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-cf3c2b25-b181-4205-ba41-742b5db5b197">
<p>
Contrary to Knuth’s assertion in the quote given in the first article in
this series that literate programming lets him program faster, it’s a
fair assessment that adopting a literate programming approach might
actually require more time — in the worst case, perhaps as much as
double. Of course, the notion is that this extra investment of time will
repay itself many times over the coming years, by saving on maintenance
costs, or serving as great teaching material for new folks, but
unfortunately not only developers, but managers and business people as
well, tend to be more interested in how fast they can get something
working and shipped.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-adf8b1ca-44e4-4935-9be8-6d7dd267a16c">
<p>
This problem is aggravated by a particular mentality found in some
quarters of our industry that no kind of documentation, or comments, is
really necessary in the first place, because after, real developers
write “self-documenting code”, or in a variation of this line of
thought, real developers can figure out any code; some people say that
if you need to understand what code does you can just ask the person who
wrote it (if they’re still with the company, of course).
</p>

<p>
In its extreme incarnation, this mentality actually claims that comments
are evil and should be abolished. After all, why should I adorn a line
saying <code>initialize();</code> with a comment saying <code>// Initialize variables</code>?
These “antidocs” people variously claim that comments, in addition to
being superfluous, are subject to code rot — which of course they are,
unless someone keeps them up to date; that “wrong documentation is worse
than no documentation”; or that comments are actually a way of covering
up for poor coding practices, and in that sense may even indirectly
promote such poor coding practices, and on and on.
</p>

<p>
People who don’t believe in commenting their code are obviously not
going to be the least bit interested in literate programming, which can
be viewed as commenting on steroids. The prevalence of this attitude is
definitely a factor working against restoring any level of interest in
literate programming.

<h3 id="h-9a403545-32fc-45c1-b99e-18532c065ae0"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> IDEs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-9a403545-32fc-45c1-b99e-18532c065ae0">
<p>
I personally believe that a lot of the blame for the demise of literate
programming can be laid at the feet of the folks making IDEs. As
programmers, we spend most of our time these days living inside
IDEs. We’ve gotten spoiled by their auto-complete features, in-line
error indications, and integrated build/run/debug features. We use them
for everything from downloading libraries to sending commands to our
phones to collaborative editing. Few if any programmers are going to
leave the warm embrace of their IDE and fire up a text editor to enter
cryptic commands in some literate programming language.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the IDEs do offer plug-ins. But in most cases, the plug-in
architecture does not expose the kind of functionality one would need to
implement literate programming in the IDE. If the IDE talks to some kind
of language service in the background, which reports syntax errors,
plugins may not be able to easily get their hands on that information in
order to display error annotations in the literate programming version
of the file.
</p>

<p>
Let’s be clear: there is no specific reason why IDEs could not offer
literate programming features. They simply don’t feel it’s a
priority. As a result, an entire generation of engineers has learned to
program in an environment where they couldn’t use literate programming
even if they wanted to. To be fair to the people making IDEs, there is a
chicken-and-egg problem here; they don’t want to provide a feature no
one is asking for, yet it is the very presence of the feature which
could help restore the popularity of literate programming popular.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one problem is that the people building IDEs are confused about
what flavor of literate programming to implement. No one wants to go
back to Knuth’s arcane original notation, which lives on in
noweb. Certainly no one other than hold-outs in academia want to go
anywhere near literate programming that involves LaTeX. But the IDE
folks are smart and can figure this out. Markdown, or some variant
thereof, is a perfectly serviceable, widely-used format for textual
narrative, and in fact is already used in several of the few isolated
experiments on literate programming being done by zealots to this day;
for output, HTML is probably enough, but it’s not hard to also support
other formats such as <code>.doc</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, or even <code>.epub</code>, in case someone wants
to curl up in bed with your program.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-433ccf98-b471-4cfd-91ec-258b3a419a1c">
<p>
By definition, literate programming requires an extra build step — the so-called “tangle” step of extracting and re-arranging the program code in the literate programming source into compilable or executable form. Although tangling usually involves nothing more than a quick command invocation, it is nevertheless yet another step to worry about and potentially go wrong — who wants today’s deployment to fail because of a lint error from some literate programming Markdown syntax?
</p>

<p>
In an era of source maps which allows us to map back compiled and transpiled code to the original source, or transformed CSS back to its pre-processor origins, there is a risk that we will be unable to map the code being executed back to the literate program we wrote — current approaches, such as they are, don’t address this issue at all.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it may be an issue that the tangling step also takes time; it should be quick, but every second counts.
</p>

<p>
Recent attempts to provide literate programming tools around the web
stack don’t really address these tooling issues in a convincing way.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-e0f4e384-0e7f-4f70-b3b1-0e63adae87c3">
<p>
Knuth invented literate programming in the previous century. Although literate programming has many advantages that have withstood the test of time, there have also been massive changes in the computing world, some of which might make literate programming less pertinent. One of those is the advent of version control.
</p>

<p>
Knuth did not have any version control at all that we know of, much less “commit messages” or “pull requests”. Commit messages — if written carefully — can provide a useful kind of documentation for a system, with the added advantage that they are ordered chronologically, so the most recent ones come up first, with the older ones aging away gracefully. git and other version control systems can search commit messages, and we can find all the files involved in a particular commit whose message we have found.
</p>

<p>
This approach to consciously using commit messages for documentation has
been called “literate version control”. In addition to commit messages,
modern development methodologies, repository management systems, and
issue and bug tracking systems will capture code review comments and bug
discussions, all of which represent a kind of documentation, which has
the advantage almost by definition of being mostly about the things we
really care about. On the other hand, programmers who are not inclined
to comment their code, much less program in literal programming style,
are likely to also be the ones who write useless commit messages like
“Fixed bug”.

<p>
As alluded to above, one of Knuth’s motivations in developing <code>WEB</code> was
the lack of macros in Pascal, and other language restrictions. Today’s
languages generally do provide macro or meta-programming
facilities. Chunks of code can be factored out into separate functions
within the parent function (in many languages, at least — actually this
was true for Pascal as well), and given meaningful names, with very low
run-time overhead — some engines may even inline them for you, and some
IDEs provide this kind of “refactoring” feature, so in this view there
is no need to rely on literate programming to manage our “chunks” for
us.

It’s safe to say that one key development in software over the last
decades has been a huge focus on testing, testing frameworks, testing
methodologies, and testing tools. We use the term “test-driven
development” here in its broadest sense — development which takes tests
seriously and devotes a meaningful amount of its time to developing and
maintaining tests. Literate programming has never provided a convincing
story about how it would co-exist with today’s test-centric priorities.

As software developers, the world around us is changing much more
rapidly than ever before. Software can now be modified and deployed in
hours, rather than months or years. Our modern culture and business
environment has grown more dynamic, demanding that software change
faster to keep up. We no longer have the luxury of sitting in our
armchairs tweaking pixels and internal program structure. For literate
programming, the question is whether things are now moving too fast to
accommodate literate programming — or is literate programming actually a
savvy way to deal with the increased rate of change?

<p>
It’s now 2018, nearly two decades after the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. On the one
hand, that manifesto says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and <b>helping others do it.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
“Helping others do it” sure sounds like something that literate
programming could help with. And the twelve principles include:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
which definitely sounds like something that literate programming could
contribute to, since literate programming could certainly be considered
one aspect of “technical excellence”, and makes design explicit,
communicates it clearly, and facilitates peer review. On the other hand,
the manifesto goes on to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We have to come to value working software over <b>comprehensive documentation.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Depending on how you look at it, that could be taken as a criticism of
literate programming, to the extent you view it as “comprehensive
documention” which slows down getting to “working software”.
</p>

<p>
So which is it? Is agile supportive, not supportive, or indifferent to
literate programming? One insightful contributor to a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10069748">Hacker News thread</a>
from 2015 put it well:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I don’t think literate programming is incompatible with the original
agile manifesto, but I think it wouldn’t survive in what that seems to
have turned into.

<p>
This article is not about justifying, or criticizing, or commenting on
the evolution of agile or scrum. Suffice it to say that moving toward
literate programming is almost certainly going to require a change in
mindset for the manager used to locking down features which are going to
get shipped next Tuesday or else, or getting evaluated on whether or not
they are shipped.

<p>
Literate programming is about expressing, and communicating program
design, in addition to individual pieces of code. (As such, it is also a
great way to share, review, and collaborate on designs.) By “program
design”, we refer to internal design — the structure of the modules and
components that make up the piece of solution, and their interfaces with
each other and the outside world.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the past decades have seen an inexorable decline in the
practice of internal design. Far too many programmers these days believe
that the first step in software is to sit down right away in front of
the computer and start typing code, instead of first <i>thinking</i>, which is
what program design is about. It’s also hard to do too much thinking or
internal design when your manager is breathing down your neck about the
release next Tuesday. It’s hard to get into an internal design mentality
when none of your co-workers, or engineering managers who should know
better, care about it or even know how to do it. A generation of
programmers who have learned to program by copying and pasting fragments
of jQuery is not suddenly going to adopt an internal design mentality.
</p>

<p>
Literate programming has the potential to stand in an interesting
feedback loop with a revival in internal design. It can both benefit
from a greater focus on internal design; and by its very nature, can
contribute to that focus.

In days of yore, monolithic programs were the rule, going all the way
back to the 1000-card deck of punched cards that made up your FORTRAN
program. Programming languages and development environments did not
support breaking systems down into modules, or communiation among
modules, at least not to the extend we know today. Literate programming
as we know it has never really addressed the modularization of the
world. How did individual literate programs relate to each other, or
refer to each other? Literate programs like TeX appear to have been
basically been one monstrous file, perhaps with simple inclusion
mechanisms, which when “woven” turned into the TeX book.

the potential of Knuth’s conceptual breakthrough.

<p>
However, I now see clearly that this ambitious enterprise cannot
possibly be realized in one additional article. A full rethinking of
literate programming might take a year, or a decade. It will require an
immense amount of conceptualization, invention, experimentation, and
development. So in this, the third article in the series, I will limit
myself to framing the problem, presenting the desiderata — the
requirements — for a new model and a new era of literate programming,
and provide the briefest of sketches of how we could move toward
satisfying them, in the form of a new medium I call a “litbook”, a
vastly enhanced type of ebook which is real-time, instrumented,
hyperconnected, and learning-equipped.

Let us start by reminding ourselves of Knuth’s incisive definition of
literate programming:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Literate programming harmonizes the human and machine aspects of
programming into an integral whole which best expresses and communicates
a software solution.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This definition is notable for Knuth’s characteristically careful choice
of words, as well as the way in which it painstakingly abstracts away
any aspects of literate programming which were dependent on the
technologies or media of the time. It’s worth going over each word used
in this definition, with help from the dictionary:
</p>

<p>
<b>Harmonize.</b> “Combine in a pleasing fashion”; “coordinate”; “bring into alignment”; “blend”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Integral whole.</b> “A unit formed from the interrelated composition of all essential parts.”
</p>

<p>
<b>Express.</b> “Represent, such in words”; “give or convey”; “depict”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Communicate.</b> “Convey knowledge of or information about”.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-6f2438f9-d72d-42da-bf96-eb8c5d53b6ea">
<p>
Knuth’s characterization of literate programming is so robust that in
and of itself it needs hardly any adjustment to our current reality
thirty-five years later. Twenty years into this bright new millennium,
we still — perhaps more than ever — want to express and communicate the
“human and machine aspects of our software solutions” as a harmonized,
integrated whole. The only differences worthy of note today are that
today our software solutions are more complex, and often composed from
sub-solutions, including third-party products. Contrast this with
something like TeX , for example, which was an almost entirely
stand-alone software system; this raises the question of what level of
granularity we should choose when creating works of literate
programming. We will revisit this topic later in the article.
</p>

<p>
If I were to quibble about Knuth’s formulation, it would be to wonder
why he stopped short of mentioning the <i>purpose</i> of expressing and
communicating. I would be very surprised were it not the case that for
Knuth a major goal was simply to present a software solution in a way
enabling it to be appreciated for its intrinsic beauty, whether of
design or implementation; and, by extension, to pass on, directly or
indirectly, principles and techniques that could be used by
practitioners in the future. These remain admirable objectives for
literate programming to this day, at least within the academic, research
and education domains.
</p>

<p>
TeX, however, has essentially remain unchanged since v3 came out in
1989, when the character representation went to eight bits. (TeX has not
changed at all since v3.14159265, according to Knuth’s quirky
digits-of-pi-based versioning system, which came out in 2014; the next
revision, which will add another digit (3), is planned for 2020). Thus,
“TeX: The Program”, the literate programming version of TeX published in
1984, was only to a negligible extent about capturing information
required by maintainers. Today, in contrast, our systems tend to have
longer maintenance lifetimes, and thus the relative importance of
literate programming-like documents for purposes of teaching maintainers
the code has grown. Since there are presumably fewer people maintaining
a piece of software than wanting to understand its aesthetics, this also
implies that works of literate programming in our day are likely to have
smaller audiences.
</p>

<p>
In other words: in the 2020s, literate programming must re-orient itself
from being about museum catalogs describing beautiful, finished,
self-contained software objects, to be read in leisurely fashion,
towards being about guides to messy, tangled systems which are
undergoing ongoing development, targeting an audience with a decidedly
shorter attention span.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h-0b6833fe-bc8d-49bf-bacb-c7735e20386f">
<p>
It’s unlikely that Knuth considered any medium for his works of literate
programming other than the printed page, as he used for “TeX: The
Program” and “Metafont: The Program”. At the time, there would have been
few if any alternatives. And the physical book has massive advantages as
a medium for “expressing and communicating” information, which account
for its extraordinary durability as an artifact of our civilization,
dating back more than four thousand years. Those advantages include:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Books are discrete objects, which can be stored, carried around, given away, and their identity remembered.</li>
<li>Books typically cover a topic or tell a story in its entirety, in some depth.</li>
<li>Books provide a default path through the information, and it is very common to be useful to read a book from beginning to end.</li>
<li>Books can have indexes to quickly identify references to a particular topic.</li>
<li>Locations in books can be bookmarked.</li>
<li>Books often supply notes and/or bibliographies.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Most of these things would be highly useful, if not indispensable, in
any vehicle via which literate programming were to be delivered. After
all, if we consider that our objective is to “tell a story” about a
piece of software, what better medium than the classic storybook?
</p>

<p>
Aside from the heft of the printed volume and the distinctive smell of
the paper, we can now replicate most of the characteristics of books in
ebooks. Ebooks also offer the programmability necessary for things like
animations (although very few do). However, for reasons that may never
be fully elucidated, ebooks have failed to fully realize their potential
as the ubiquitous, self-contained, portable, digital containers of
information that many once hoped they would become. Most people today
probably think an ebook is the bastardized format you read on a Kindle,
and would not even know how to consume an EPUB if one fell into their
hands.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the diminishing popularity of the ebook format, we think
it remains an excellent candidate for the vehicle via which to deliver
literate programming content, with certain key enhancements and
extensions. While preserving the strengths of the ebook format as we
know it, together with features already found in many ebooks such as
full-text search, hyperlinking of course, smart (e.g. animated) content,
and multiple navigational paths, we need to add the capability for
auto-updating, self-learning, instrumentation, and
personalization. Until someone comes up with a better name, let us call
this flavor of ebook a literate programming book, or litbook.
</p>

<p>
Litbooks must be tightly coupled to the repository and source code
control systems which are ubiquitous today. We also think it’s important
that they have advanced query mechanisms, and be intelligent in the
sense that they know, or can learn, what portions of the content are
most useful and what might be missing.
</p>

<p>
Critically, they must also be easily updatable in a semi-automated
fashion. Software solutions today not only have longer maintenance and
upgrade lifetimes, but are maintained and upgraded on a faster cadence —
much faster in many cases. And as we all know, the only thing worse than
no documentation is out-of-date documentation. Any model for literate
programming in the 2020’s must accommodate such rapid release
cycles. Just as we continuously integrate, and continuously deploy, we
must start to continuously document. In other words, in addition to CI
and CD we must have CL, meaning “continuous litbooking”. No feature or
subsystem should be considered complete until it is reflected in updated
works of a literate programming nature, any more than in today’s world a
feature or subsystem would be considered complete without accompanying
unit tests and/or integration tests.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it is imperative that our litbook approach avoid the “initial
cliff” — the inability to generate any useful literate programming
materials until program writers have made a specific investment of time
in preparing or writing litbook-specific content. We need to be able to
create litbooks from plain old software systems, using various
heuristics. This could be called “monotonic documentation” — meaning
that each incremental investment in litbooking provides in incrementally
more useful litbooks.
</p>

<p>
What approach would Knuth choose if he were to reinvent literate
programming today? How we would like to hear his input. Would it be
anything like the litbooks we have imagined here?
