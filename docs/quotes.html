You wonder what I am doing? Well, so do I, in truth. Days seem to dawn,
suns to shine, evenings to follow, and then I sleep. What I have done,
what I am doing, what I am going to do, puzzle and bewilder me. Have you
ever been a leaf and fallen from your tree in autumn and been really
puzzled about it? That's the feeling.

<p>
&#x2026;episodes of intense emotional distress and disorder often reflect
natural (and, yes, even healthy) expressions of an individual's
struggles toward reorganization. Such struggles are not always
successful, of course, but they may be viewed with substantially less
fear and impatience if they are construed as the activities of an open,
developing system in search of a "more extensive balance" with its
world.

We shall not cease from exploration<br>
And the end of all our exploring<br>
Will be to arrive where we started<br>
And know the place for the first time.<br>
Through the unknown, remembered gate<br>
When the last of earth left to discover<br>
Is that which was the beginning;<br>
At the source of the longest river<br>
The voice of the hidden waterfall<br>
And the children in the apple-tree<br>
<br>
Not known, because not looked for<br>
But heard, half-heard, in the stillness<br>
Between two waves of the sea.<br>
Quick now, here, now, always&#x2013;<br>
A condition of complete simplicity<br>
(Costing not less than everything)<br>
And all shall be well and<br>
All manner of thing shall be well<br>
When the tongues of flames are in-folded<br>
Into the crowned knot of fire<br>
And the fire and the rose are one.<br>

<p>
Which is more important, the truth or what people believe? Most would
say the truth, but that is too easy. No one actually <i>wants</i> the
truth. Not in this universe. Hearing the truth is like looking on the
face of a god &#x2014; you have a moment of pure revelation, and then you are
ash carried away to oblivion, knowing nothing, seeing nothing.  When
people say they want the truth, they mean that they want something they
can understand, something that fits, that they can carry around in their
thoughts like a relic, to touch and take away the fear of what they are
living.
</p>

<p>
Am I a traitor? Am I one soul, or am I many? Have I had many names or
only the one? Do I wish redemption or vengeance? It's comforting to be
able to pick one, and then see everything fall into line behind it &#x2014;
villain-hero, right-wrong, on and on. That's what people want when they
ask for the truth. They want the lie that makes the world simple.
</p>

<p>
But you are not like that, are you? You know that it is better not to
ask for the truth. That what you should ask for are secrets. (pg 111)

<p>
Olly Piers simmered for a moment, then straightened his shako, and
glared at him.
</p>

<p>
"Look around. Look at the shit around you, boy. <b>This is what the very</b>
<b>edge looks like. The very brink. This is what it looks like when you're</b>
<b>holding on so desperately there's no skin left on your</b>
<b>finger­bones. This is when it matters most. This is when it makes the</b>
<b>difference between living and dying. You take whatever you can to blaze</b>
<b>up your spirits. Anything. A truth, a lie, it doesn't matter. You use</b>
<b>whatever you can to keep you going, and you share it with whoever's with</b>
<b>you. Whatever you've got, you understand? Whatever keeps you going one</b>
<b>more step. That's how you live. That's how you win. That's how you</b>
<b>survive, and how your friends and your comrades survive with you, so you</b>
<b>can all tell glory tales afterwards, and make even more bullshit up to</b>
<b>get you through shitstorms to come.</b>"
</p>

<p>
"Piers, that's a really cynical way of&#x2014;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, piss yourself off a cliff, you precious little high-minded
historian shit-streak, and take your pious little notion of what truth
and history means with you! It's your pissing history books that prove
my case! <b>The power of myths and lies and frigging stories have got us</b>
<b>through thirty frigging thousand years of shit, so I'm gonna go out on a</b>
<b>limb and suggest it's a pretty effective bloody formula!</b>
</p>

<p>
"Besides," he added, slumping back against the trench wall, his voice
dropping, "it frigging well <i>was</i> Mythrus. [&#x2026;]"
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
He slithered forward, keeping his head below the trench lip as a volley
of shots went over. He grabbed Hari by the shoulder roughly, turned him
around, and pointed along the trench.
</p>

<p>
"What's that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Hari looked. Twenty metres away, a squad of Auxilia were man­handling a
battle banner upright. The Emperor Ascendant, in a sunburst.
</p>

<p>
"A banner," said Hari.
</p>

<p>
"And look, boy, how it takes four&#x2026;no, five, look&#x2026;men to get it
upright and displayed. That's five soldiers who could be firing rifles
at enemy targets. But the idea matters more. It rallies us. It reminds
us why we're here. It could be anything. It could be a picture of a
giant rabbit. It could be a picture of my hairy frigging arse. Doesn't
matter. <b>It reminds us, plain and simple, that there's a point to what</b>
<b>we're doing, and a reason to keep doing it. Without it, we're just a</b>
<b>bunch of frigging idiots shitting ourselves in a ditch. Now think on</b>
<b>that, and get your sodding arse out of here.</b>"
</p>

<p>
(Emphasis mine)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hari blinked. He had no idea why soldiers lied. If this was war, the
actual inside of war, then why did they make shit up? No tall tale, not
even one spun by a skilled, serial liar like Olly Piers, could ever hope
to match the astonishing truth of war. Lies were smaller than war. No
lie, no matter how cocky and outrageous, was ever going to take war on
and win.
</p>

<p>
War was a scream in capital letters. It was a noise. It wasn't even
words. It had no syntax, no adjectives, no subtext, no context. It
communicated itself as suddenly, simply and unequivocally as a punch in
the face. It was a thing, not a story.
</p>

<p>
Then maybe that was why. That was why soldiers lied. It was the only
way, the only meagre, insufficient way they could talk about what they
had endured. It was the only way they could give voice to something that
defied articulation. War was so big, soldiers needed to get it out of
themselves, spew it out, purge themselves, and lies were the only things
that worked. It was either that, or punch someone else in the face.
</p>

<p>
Unless&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Hari blinked again. Now he grasped it. The lies weren't exorcism. At
least, not completely. They were protection. After the fact, after the
brute scream of war, the lies weren't a means to talk about something
that defied words. They weren't approximate expression. They were
curative. They were comfort. The lies were lies of glory and heroism,
achievement and success. They weren't born out of arrogance or boasting
or self-aggrandisement. They were just ways to talk about something that
was otherwise unbearable. They were coping strategies to insulate
survivors against the madness and the punch in the face. They were ways
to make war feel like it had some point, some value, some lasting
worth. Lies made war better for those unlucky enough to survive it.
</p>

<p>
Lies gave soldiers something to think about, and talk about, and
cherish, so they would never have to&#x2026;never, ever have to think about
the truth.
</p>

<p>
"It's a stupid bloody time to figure that out&#x2026;" Hari murmured to
himself. He laughed, for want of anything else to do.
</p>

<p>
"What?" Piers yelled. "What did you say?"
</p>

<p>
Hari looked at him. Olly Piers, shako on crooked, meal-tin spills down
the front of his coat, rancid of breath, half-covered in dirt and
grease, too old by far to be having to do this all over again. What a
horrible life you must have lived, Piers, to have become such a
magnificent liar. What terrible things you must have seen to make you
need to lie so much. That's what you were telling me all along, and I
was too stupid to comprehend. I had no frame of reference.
</p>

<p>
I have it now, thought Hari. I wish I didn't. I would give anything not
to have had this experience, and not to be here. There is no truth here,
no story, no words. There's nothing to take from this of any worth, and
all my high-minded ambitions to come along and brave the dangers in
order to capture something valuable were bullshit.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing here to cherish. Nothing here to learn. War is noise,
sensory overload, pain, terror, horror. That's it. It's an inarticulate
obscenity. It can't be communicated, and even if it could be, it
shouldn't be.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
"What's Olly short for?" Hari asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm writing your story," said Hari. "I wanted to get your name right."
</p>

<p>
"I don't have a story," Piers rumbled, and went back to scrubbing. "I
have stories, plural. Many fine stories. But not <i>a</i> story. I am a
complicated man. I will not be reduced or abbreviated."
</p>

<p>
"Except to Olly."
</p>

<p>
"Shut your hole, clever clogs."

<p>
If stories ever end, then this story ends here. [&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
I think, though it is not my field of specialisation, that some stories
end, but others carry on. They are eternal. They secretly carry on after
the story appears to be finished, continuing in silence. They do not
talk. They are never heard. I think my story may be like that.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
And I think my story ends here too. Soon.
</p>

<p>
I would have liked to tell it to someone. Share it. But that sort of
connection is something I have never been allowed.
</p>

<p>
Here are the things I would have said.
</p>

<p>
I am fighting to the end in a battle that cannot be won. I am fighting
to the end in a battle that I knew could not be won before it even began.
I am doing this, not because I am brave, or because I am foolish, but
because it was the only thing to do. If we give up on the doomed, we
give up on ourselves.
</p>

<p>
My presence, the curse of my company, has kept the doomed souls alive a
little longer than fate had planned. I have not driven off the daemons
or the night, for they are too strong for even me. But I have held them
at bay for a while. I have made the daemons wary. (Pg 531)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
At the Eternity Wall space port, late in a very long life, I have
discovered to my joy that my presence, the curse of my company, can also
be a blessing.  This is new to me, and unfamiliar. I have fought to
protect these people, who cannot see me, but the mystery of me &#x2014; for it
appears it can be a mystery as well as a curse &#x2014; has inspired them. The
fact of my absence is a place they cannot explain, so they have filled
it with stories and ideas, and those stories and ideas have given them
strength and hope and courage.
</p>

<p>
I never planned for that. I did not set out to do it. It simply
happened.  These are strange times.
</p>

<p>
I will confess, now, because no one is listening, that this has been the
greatest accomplishment of my life. It is completely unexpected. My
whole life, I have stood apart, and wherever I have gone, I have spread
only fear and discomfort. But here, briefly and unexpectedly, I have
affected people in another way. I have been an unlikely conduit for
strength and unity. I have been a mystery that has compelled them to
stand up and believe, not cower and shrink in fear.
</p>

<p>
I have been able to touch them.
</p>

<p>
This is my fortune. It is all I have ever wanted.
</p>

<p>
I wish it could continue, but it will not. As I have said, this is a
story that is reaching its end. (Pp. 532&#x2013;533)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the boy had been there, he'd have asked Piers if he was
afraid. Because he always asked such stupid questions. But Piers would
have answered him. He'd have said "no".

Because he always lied.

<blockquote>
<p>
Humanity has always managed to summon a poetic turn of phrase for the
projected end of everything. Scribes love to speak of how things fall
apart, the centre unable to hold &#x2014; contrasting the rise of oceans with
the fall of empires. Philosophers claim the end will come not with a
bang, but with a whimper. And of death? Nothing to fear, they
promise. Death is merely another path.
</p>

<p>
These sentiments are always composed by men and women far removed from
any experience of what the end of all things would really be.
<b>It's easy to fall back on sanguine philosophy when you can't comprehend
the truth.</b> Yes, the centre cannot hold, but its dissolution means the
genocide of trillions. Yes, death is another path, but that path leads
to the soul of every man, woman and child sliding into the open mouths
of mad gods.
</p>

<p>
Had the ancient wise ones seen such things with their own eyes, perhaps
their scrawls would have been somewhat less serene.
</p>

<p>
But a coin has two sides. Twinned with the serenity of ignorance is the
spectre of hope. People will resist the end, even against the evidence
of their eyes and the workings of their minds. Logic plays no part in
it. This is the arena of hope, with survival instincts baked into the
brain of every living being. Emotions like that burn through anything as
cold and blunt as reason. (Chapter 8, emphasis mine)
